      "\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3m📰 **First migrants could be detained within days under UK-France small boats deal**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewykzegy4qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The UK-French \"one-in, one-out\" pilot scheme, aimed at reducing the number of small boats crossing the Channel, has come into force with detentions of illegal migrants due to start within days.The deal will see some of those arriving in the UK in small boats detained and returned to France.In exchange the UK will accept from France an equal number of asylum seekers provided they have not already tried to make the crossing and can pass security and eligibility checks.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"product of months of grown-up diplomacy\" which would \"deliver real results\".But the Conservatives said it would \"make no difference whatsoever\".\n",
      "Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the agreement in July, but it was still subject to legal scrutiny by the European Commission and EU member states.The UK government has now said that the \"EU Commission, Germany and other member states have given the green light on this innovative approach\" meaning the scheme can go ahead.Under the plan, an adult migrant who tries to get to the UK by crossing the Channel could be returned to France if their claim for asylum was deemed to be inadmissible. Returns could begin to take place within weeks.UK and international law prevents the government from sending asylum seekers back to their country of origin before their claim has been considered and turned down. However, they can be sent to safe countries prepared to consider their claim.\n",
      "The government did not confirm how many migrants would be returned and accepted under the plan, but said it would look to \"ramp up both the pace and scale of returns over the course of the pilot scheme\".There have been reports that 50 people per week could be returned, compared with the weekly average of more than 800 people currently making the crossing.Sir Keir has previously said the pilot is not \"a silver bullet\" but he believes it will deter people from making the dangerous journey following a big increase in the numbers so far this year.As of 30 July, more than 25,000 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - around 49% higher than at the same point in 2024.\n",
      "The government is under pressure to reduce the numbers, having previously promised to \"smash the gangs\" organising the journeys.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper hailed the agreement as \"ground breaking\" and an \"important step towards undermining the business model of the organised crime gangs\".\"It is also right to make clear that – while the UK will always be ready to play its part alongside other countries in helping those fleeing persecution and conflict – this must be done in a controlled and managed legal way, not through dangerous, illegal, and uncontrolled routes,\" she said.On Monday, the government announced £100m to fund 300 National Crime Agency Officers to stop the people smugglers arranging the crossings.It has also said it wants to tackle illegal working, reducing pull factors which encourage people to come to the UK.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's deal with the French would be less effective than the Rwanda plan proposed by the previous Conservative government.\"The Rwanda removals deterrent, under which 100% of illegal arrivals would be removed, was ready to go last summer but Labour cancelled it just days before it was due to start with no proper replacement plan,\" he said.\"As a result, this year so far has been the worst ever for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.\"When the UK and France first announced the plan in July, the charity Asylum Matters criticised the measure, arguing: \"The only way to stop people from making dangerous journeys is to give them real safe routes to seek sanctuary.\"...\n",

      "📰 **Obesity jab patients need a plan to stop weight coming back, health experts say**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3jg20j1ro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 People coming off obesity jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro should have check-ups for at least a year to make sure they don't pile weight back on, new advice for the NHS says.It's not uncommon for people to regain most of what they shed once they stop treatment,experience shows.The guidance, from health assessment body NICE, warns weight management is a long-term journey, not a short-term fix.Patients may need extra support and a plan for how to stay at their new weight, such as eating healthily and hitting the gym or going for walks, it says.\n",
      "In England alone, obesity affects around one in four adults.Anestimated 1.5 millionpeople are on weight loss jabs in the UK, but the vast majority are paying for them privately so will not be eligible for NHS support as they come off the treatment.Wegovy (semaglutide) is already available on the NHS on prescription, but only to those most in need (with health problems due to their weight and a high BMI) for a period of two years.Around 240,000 people are expected to be offered Mounjaro (tirzepatide) over the next three years. There's currently no specified time limit for being prescribed the drug.Both drugs help reduce appetite and can lead to life-changing weight loss. They are prescribed alongside programmes that support healthy weight loss through changes to diet and physical activity.In aWegovy drug trial, patients regained around two-thirds of their original weight once they came off the injections. It's a similar story for those onMounjaro.New advice from NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, encourages patients to build long-term behavioural habits, use self-monitoring tools, and draw on wider support \"from online communities to family-led interventions and local activities.\"Prof Jonathan Benger from NICE said: \"Successful weight management doesn't end when medication stops or when someone completes a behavioural programme.\"We know that the transition period after treatment is crucial, and people need structured support to maintain the positive changes they've made.\"Prof Kamila Hawthorn from the Royal College of GPs said: \"There is no one-size fits all approach to tackling obesity - what works for one patient will likely not work for another.\"We also need to see a greater focus on prevention, stopping people becoming overweight in the first place so they don't require a medical intervention later.\"Obesity can cause people difficulties in their daily lives, and put them at more risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.\n",

      "📄 Thousands of homes are still without power and trains remain suspended in the aftermath of Storm Floris.Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said 22,000 homes were without power as of 08:00 but said it had managed to restore supplies to 50,000 homes.Network Rail said teams had been working \"tirelessly\" to clear routes with 119 incidents reported on train lines across Scotland on Monday, amid gusts of up to 90mph in some parts.Cancelled trains and flights caused widespread disruption across the UK on Monday, with early reports from aviation analytics firm Cirium suggesting that at least 68 departure flights were cancelled as a result of the storm.\n",
      "SSEN said Floris was \"the most damaging summer storm in recent memory\" with thousands of properties hit in the Highlands, Moray and Aberdeenshire.A spokesman said: \"Our teams worked for as long as the light permitted last night, and were deployed again early this morning, with the support of helicopters to assess the network from above.\"Expanded teams in our control room and customer contact centre also worked through the night to reroute supplies remotely where possible and answer customer queries.\"This has been a particularly damaging storm, and we'll be working hard to reconnect customers as safely and quickly as we can – but it will take time. We thank people for their patience and understanding while we do this.\"\n",
      "The Scottish government held an emergency meeting on Monday night in response to the \"significant disruption\" caused by the storm.Justice and Home Affairs Secretary Angela Constance said travel should be avoided if possible until the danger had passed.She said that power cuts were still affecting a \"significant\" number of properties, and that the recovery period would take time despite an improving forecast over the rest of the week.\"We will continue to receive updates throughout Tuesday and will have a better idea on public transport tomorrow morning,\" she added.ScotRail urged customers to check their journey via the app, website or JourneyCheck before travelling on Tuesday.The Met Office has warned that a further period of unseasonable wet and windy weather is on the way late on Wednesday and into Thursday for those in north-western parts of the UK.\n",
      "SSEN  said free hot food and drinks would be provided on Tuesday in areas where homes were awaiting reconnection.Confirmed food locations are:DINGWALL - Maryburgh Hub HallHUNTLY - Market Muir Car ParkWICK - Bilbster HallLAIRG -Village car parkKYLE OF LOCHALSH - Lochalsh Leisure CentreNetwork Rail reported 75 tree-related incidents across the network, including trees falling on to overhead lines at King's Park in Glasgow, Cornton near Stirling and Bishopton near Paisley.It said some train disruption would continue as checks were carried out on Tuesday morning.\n",
      "Ross Moran, Network Rail Scotland's route director, said: \"Storm Floris has caused significant disruption to Scotland's railway.\"As the storm passes our focus switches to inspecting routes which have been closed by fallen trees, debris and other damage.\"We'll use two helicopters to assist engineers on the ground. We're grateful to passengers for their patience whilst we do this.\"Flights and ferries were also suspended across Scotland on Monday with people urged to avoid travel.Most of the country's major road bridges were closed to high-sided vehicles.Vehicles were blown over in Glasgow and Skye, while the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and other major events were cancelled.\n",
      "Edinburgh Fringe Festival said about 110 shows had been cancelled - mostly those in temporary structures.In Glasgow, location filming for the superhero blockbusterSpider-Man: Brand New Daywas suspended in the city centre.The SQA also warned that the weather would delay the delivery of exam results letters on Tuesday for pupils on Scotland's islands.\n",
      "A Met Office amber warning, covering a wide area from the central belt to the Highlands, expired at 23:00 on Monday.Western coastal areas saw the strongest early gusts with the high winds moving north-east later.The Met Office said summer storms caused problems as trees were in full leaf and were more likely to be toppled with branches broken off.Tuesday is forecast to be a calmer day as Storm Floris moves towards Scandinavia....\n",

      "📰 **Disfigured, shamed and forgotten: BBC visits the Korean survivors of the Hiroshima bomb**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8zlwd3e42o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 At 08:15 on August 6, 1945, as a nuclear bomb was falling like a stone through the skies over Hiroshima, Lee Jung-soon was on her way to elementary school.The now-88-year-old waves her hands as if trying to push the memory away.\"My father was about to leave for work, but he suddenly came running back and told us to evacuate immediately,\" she recalls. \"They say the streets were filled with the dead – but I was so shocked all I remember is crying. I just cried and cried.\"Victims' bodies \"melted away so only their eyes were visible\", Ms Lee says, as a blast equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT enveloped a city of 420,000 people. What remained in the aftermath were corpses too mangled to be identified.\"The atomic bomb… it's such a terrifying weapon.\"It's been 80 years since the United States detonated 'Little Boy', humanity's first-ever atomic bomb, over the centre of Hiroshima, instantly killing some 70,000 people. Tens of thousands more would die in the coming months from radiation sickness, burns and dehydration.The devastation wrought by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – which brought a decisive end to both World War Two and Japanese imperial rule across large swaths of Asia – has been well-documented over the past eight decades.Less well-known is the fact that about 20% of the immediate victims were Koreans.Korea had been a Japanese colony for 35 years when the bomb was dropped. An estimated 140,000 Koreans were living in Hiroshima at the time - many having moved there due to forced labour mobilisation, or to survive under colonial exploitation.Those who survived the atom bomb, along with their descendants, continue to live in the long shadow of that day – wrestling with disfigurement, pain, and a decades-long fight for justice that remains unresolved.\n",
      "\"No-one takes responsibility,\" says Shim Jin-tae, an 83-year-old survivor. \"Not the country that dropped the bomb. Not the country that failed to protect us. America never apologised. Japan pretends not to know. Korea is no better. They just pass the blame - and we're left alone.\"Mr Shim now lives in Hapcheon, South Korea: a small county which, having become the home of dozens of survivors like he and Ms Lee, has been dubbed \"Korea's Hiroshima\".For Ms Lee, the shock of that day has not faded  - it etched itself into her body as illness. She now lives with skin cancer, Parkinson's disease, and angina, a condition stemming from poor blood flow to the heart, which typically manifests as chest pain.But what weighs more heavily is that the pain didn't stop with her. Her son Ho-chang, who supports her, was diagnosed with kidney failure and is undergoing dialysis while awaiting a transplant.\"I believe it's due to radiation exposure, but who can prove it?\" Ho-chang Lee says. \"It's hard to verify scientifically - you'd need genetic testing, which is exhausting and expensive.\"The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) told the BBC that it had gathered genetic data between 2020 and 2024 and would continue further studies until 2029. It would \"consider expanding the definition of victims\" to second- and- third-generation survivors only \"if the results are statistically significant\", it said.\n",
      "Of the 140,000 Koreans in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, many were from Hapcheon.Surrounded by mountains with little farmland, it was a difficult place to live. Crops were seized by the Japanese occupiers, droughts ravaged the land, and thousands of people left the rural country for Japan during the war. Some were forcibly conscripted; others were lured by the promise that \"you could eat three meals a day and send your kids to school.\"But in Japan, Koreans were second-class citizens – often given the hardest, dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. Mr Shim says his father worked in a munitions factory as a forced labourer, while his mother hammered nails into wooden ammunition crates.In the aftermath of the bomb, this distribution of labour translated into dangerous and often fatal work for Koreans in Hiroshima.\n",
      "\"Korean workers had to clean up the dead,\" Mr Shim, who is the director of the Hapcheon branch of the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, tells BBC Korean. \"At first they used stretchers, but there were too many bodies. Eventually, they used dustpans to gather corpses and burned them in schoolyards.\"It was mostly Koreans who did this. Most of the post-war clean-up and munitions work was done by us.\"According to a study by the Gyeonggi Welfare Foundation, some survivors were forced to clear rubble and recover bodies. While Japanese evacuees fled to relatives, Koreans without local ties remained in the city, exposed to the radioactive fallout – and with  limited access to medical care.A combination of these conditions - poor treatment, hazardous work and structural discrimination - all contributed to a disproportionately high death toll among Koreans.According to the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, the Korean fatality rate was  57.1%, compared to the overall rate of about 33.7%.About 70,000 Koreans were exposed to the bomb. By year's end, some 40,000 had died.\n",
      "After the bombings, which led to Japan's surrender and Korea's subsequent liberation, about 23,000 Korean survivors returned home. But they were not welcomed. Branded as disfigured or cursed, they faced prejudice even in their homeland.\"Hapcheon already had a leper colony,\" Mr Shim explains. \"And because of that image, people thought the bomb survivors had skin diseases too.\"Such stigma made survivors stay silent about their plight, he adds, suggesting that \"survival came before pride\".Ms Lee says she saw this \"with her own eyes\".\"People who were badly burned or extremely poor were treated terribly,\" she recalls. \"In our village, some people had their backs and faces so badly scarred that only their eyes were visible. They were rejected from marriage and shunned.\"With stigma came poverty, and hardship. Then came illnesses with no clear cause: skin diseases, heart conditions, kidney failure, cancer. The symptoms were everywhere - but no-one could explain them.Over time, the focus shifted to the second and third generations.\n",
      "Han Jeong-sun, a second-generation survivor, suffers from avascular necrosis in her hips, and can't walk without dragging herself. Her first son was born with cerebral palsy.\"My son has never walked a single step in his life,\" she says. \"And my in-laws treated me horribly. They said, 'You gave birth to a crippled child and you're crippled too—are you here to ruin our family?'\"That time was absolute hell.\"For decades, not even the Korean government took active interest in its own victims, as a war with the North and economic struggles were treated as higher priorities.It wasn't until 2019 - more than 70 years after the bombing - that MOHW released its first fact-finding report. That survey was mostly based on questionnaires.In response to BBC inquiries, the ministry explained that prior to 2019, \"There was no legal basis for funding or official investigations\".But two separate studies had found that second-generation victims were more vulnerable to illness. One, from 2005, showed that second-generation victims were far more likely than the general population to suffer depression, heart disease and anaemia, while another from 2013 found their disability registration rate was nearly double the national average.Against this backdrop, Ms Han is incredulous that authorities keep asking for proof to recognise her and her son as victims of Hiroshima.\"My illness is the proof. My son's disability is the proof. This pain passes down generations, and it's visible,\" she says. \"But they won't recognise it. So what are we supposed to do - just die without ever being acknowledged?\"\n",
      "It was only last month, on 12 July, that Hiroshima officials visited Hapcheon for the first time to lay flowers at a memorial. While former PM Yukio Hatoyama and other private figures had come before, this was the first official visit by current Japanese officials.\"Now in 2025 Japan talks about peace. But peace without apology is meaningless,\" says Junko Ichiba, a long-time Japanese peace activist who has spent most of her life advocating for Korean Hiroshima victims.She points out that the visiting officials gave no mention or apology for how Japan treated Korean people before and during World War Two.\n",
      "Although multiple former Japanese leaders have offered their apologies and remorse, many South Koreans regard these sentiments as insincere or insufficient without formal acknowledgement.Ms Ichiba notes  that Japanese textbooks still omit the history of Korea's colonial past - as well as its atomic bomb victims – saying that \"this invisibility only deepens the injustice\".This  adds to what many view as a broader lack of accountability for Japan's colonial legacy.Heo Jeong-gu, director of the Red Cross's support division, said, \"These issues... must be addressed while survivors are still alive. For the second and third generations, we must gather evidence and testimonies before it's too late.\"For survivors like Mr Shim it's not just about being compensated – it's about being acknowledged.\"Memory matters more than compensation,\" he says. \"Our bodies remember what we went through… If we forget, it'll happen again. And someday, there'll be no one left to tell the story.\"...\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewykzegy4qo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The UK-French \"one-in, one-out\" pilot scheme, aimed at reducing the number of small boats crossing the Channel, has come into force with detentions of illegal migrants due to start within days.The deal will see some of those arriving in the UK in small boats detained and returned to France.In exchange the UK will accept from France an equal number of asylum seekers provided they have not already tried to make the crossing and can pass security and eligibility checks.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"product of months of grown-up diplomacy\" which would \"deliver real results\".But the Conservatives said it would \"make no difference whatsoever\".\n",
      "Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the agreement in July, but it was still subject to legal scrutiny by the European Commission and EU member states.The UK government has now said that the \"EU Commission, Germany and other member states have given the green light on this innovative approach\" meaning the scheme can go ahead.Under the plan, an adult migrant who tries to get to the UK by crossing the Channel could be returned to France if their claim for asylum was deemed to be inadmissible. Returns could begin to take place within weeks.UK and international law prevents the government from sending asylum seekers back to their country of origin before their claim has been considered and turned down. However, they can be sent to safe countries prepared to consider their claim.\n",
      "The government did not confirm how many migrants would be returned and accepted under the plan, but said it would look to \"ramp up both the pace and scale of returns over the course of the pilot scheme\".There have been reports that 50 people per week could be returned, compared with the weekly average of more than 800 people currently making the crossing.Sir Keir has previously said the pilot is not \"a silver bullet\" but he believes it will deter people from making the dangerous journey following a big increase in the numbers so far this year.As of 30 July, more than 25,000 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - around 49% higher than at the same point in 2024.\n",
      "The government is under pressure to reduce the numbers, having previously promised to \"smash the gangs\" organising the journeys.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper hailed the agreement as \"ground breaking\" and an \"important step towards undermining the business model of the organised crime gangs\".\"It is also right to make clear that – while the UK will always be ready to play its part alongside other countries in helping those fleeing persecution and conflict – this must be done in a controlled and managed legal way, not through dangerous, illegal, and uncontrolled routes,\" she said.On Monday, the government announced £100m to fund 300 National Crime Agency Officers to stop the people smugglers arranging the crossings.It has also said it wants to tackle illegal working, reducing pull factors which encourage people to come to the UK.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's deal with the French would be less effective than the Rwanda plan proposed by the previous Conservative government.\"The Rwanda removals deterrent, under which 100% of illegal arrivals would be removed, was ready to go last summer but Labour cancelled it just days before it was due to start with no proper replacement plan,\" he said.\"As a result, this year so far has been the worst ever for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.\"When the UK and France first announced the plan in July, the charity Asylum Matters criticised the measure, arguing: \"The only way to stop people from making dangerous journeys is to give them real safe routes to seek sanctuary.\"...\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy3jg20j1ro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 People coming off obesity jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro should have check-ups for at least a year to make sure they don't pile weight back on, new advice for the NHS says.It's not uncommon for people to regain most of what they shed once they stop treatment,experience shows.The guidance, from health assessment body NICE, warns weight management is a long-term journey, not a short-term fix.Patients may need extra support and a plan for how to stay at their new weight, such as eating healthily and hitting the gym or going for walks, it says.\n",
      "In England alone, obesity affects around one in four adults.Anestimated 1.5 millionpeople are on weight loss jabs in the UK, but the vast majority are paying for them privately so will not be eligible for NHS support as they come off the treatment.Wegovy (semaglutide) is already available on the NHS on prescription, but only to those most in need (with health problems due to their weight and a high BMI) for a period of two years.Around 240,000 people are expected to be offered Mounjaro (tirzepatide) over the next three years. There's currently no specified time limit for being prescribed the drug.Both drugs help reduce appetite and can lead to life-changing weight loss. They are prescribed alongside programmes that support healthy weight loss through changes to diet and physical activity.In aWegovy drug trial, patients regained around two-thirds of their original weight once they came off the injections. It's a similar story for those onMounjaro.New advice from NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, encourages patients to build long-term behavioural habits, use self-monitoring tools, and draw on wider support \"from online communities to family-led interventions and local activities.\"Prof Jonathan Benger from NICE said: \"Successful weight management doesn't end when medication stops or when someone completes a behavioural programme.\"We know that the transition period after treatment is crucial, and people need structured support to maintain the positive changes they've made.\"Prof Kamila Hawthorn from the Royal College of GPs said: \"There is no one-size fits all approach to tackling obesity - what works for one patient will likely not work for another.\"We also need to see a greater focus on prevention, stopping people becoming overweight in the first place so they don't require a medical intervention later.\"Obesity can cause people difficulties in their daily lives, and put them at more risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.\n",

      "📄 Thousands of homes are still without power and trains remain suspended in the aftermath of Storm Floris.Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said 22,000 homes were without power as of 08:00 but said it had managed to restore supplies to 50,000 homes.Network Rail said teams had been working \"tirelessly\" to clear routes with 119 incidents reported on train lines across Scotland on Monday, amid gusts of up to 90mph in some parts.Cancelled trains and flights caused widespread disruption across the UK on Monday, with early reports from aviation analytics firm Cirium suggesting that at least 68 departure flights were cancelled as a result of the storm.\n",
      "SSEN said Floris was \"the most damaging summer storm in recent memory\" with thousands of properties hit in the Highlands, Moray and Aberdeenshire.A spokesman said: \"Our teams worked for as long as the light permitted last night, and were deployed again early this morning, with the support of helicopters to assess the network from above.\"Expanded teams in our control room and customer contact centre also worked through the night to reroute supplies remotely where possible and answer customer queries.\"This has been a particularly damaging storm, and we'll be working hard to reconnect customers as safely and quickly as we can – but it will take time. We thank people for their patience and understanding while we do this.\"\n",
      "The Scottish government held an emergency meeting on Monday night in response to the \"significant disruption\" caused by the storm.Justice and Home Affairs Secretary Angela Constance said travel should be avoided if possible until the danger had passed.She said that power cuts were still affecting a \"significant\" number of properties, and that the recovery period would take time despite an improving forecast over the rest of the week.\"We will continue to receive updates throughout Tuesday and will have a better idea on public transport tomorrow morning,\" she added.ScotRail urged customers to check their journey via the app, website or JourneyCheck before travelling on Tuesday.The Met Office has warned that a further period of unseasonable wet and windy weather is on the way late on Wednesday and into Thursday for those in north-western parts of the UK.\n",
      "SSEN  said free hot food and drinks would be provided on Tuesday in areas where homes were awaiting reconnection.Confirmed food locations are:DINGWALL - Maryburgh Hub HallHUNTLY - Market Muir Car ParkWICK - Bilbster HallLAIRG -Village car parkKYLE OF LOCHALSH - Lochalsh Leisure CentreNetwork Rail reported 75 tree-related incidents across the network, including trees falling on to overhead lines at King's Park in Glasgow, Cornton near Stirling and Bishopton near Paisley.It said some train disruption would continue as checks were carried out on Tuesday morning.\n",
      "Ross Moran, Network Rail Scotland's route director, said: \"Storm Floris has caused significant disruption to Scotland's railway.\"As the storm passes our focus switches to inspecting routes which have been closed by fallen trees, debris and other damage.\"We'll use two helicopters to assist engineers on the ground. We're grateful to passengers for their patience whilst we do this.\"Flights and ferries were also suspended across Scotland on Monday with people urged to avoid travel.Most of the country's major road bridges were closed to high-sided vehicles.Vehicles were blown over in Glasgow and Skye, while the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and other major events were cancelled.\n",
      "Edinburgh Fringe Festival said about 110 shows had been cancelled - mostly those in temporary structures.In Glasgow, location filming for the superhero blockbusterSpider-Man: Brand New Daywas suspended in the city centre.The SQA also warned that the weather would delay the delivery of exam results letters on Tuesday for pupils on Scotland's islands.\n",
      "A Met Office amber warning, covering a wide area from the central belt to the Highlands, expired at 23:00 on Monday.Western coastal areas saw the strongest early gusts with the high winds moving north-east later.The Met Office said summer storms caused problems as trees were in full leaf and were more likely to be toppled with branches broken off.Tuesday is forecast to be a calmer day as Storm Floris moves towards Scandinavia....\n",

I just cried and cried.\"Victims' bodies \"melted away so only their eyes were visible\", Ms Lee says, as a blast equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT enveloped a city of 420,000 people. What remained in the aftermath were corpses too mangled to be identified.\"The atomic bomb… it's such a terrifying weapon.\"It's been 80 years since the United States detonated 'Little Boy', humanity's first-ever atomic bomb, over the centre of Hiroshima, instantly killing some 70,000 people. Tens of thousands more would die in the coming months from radiation sickness, burns and dehydration.The devastation wrought by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – which brought a decisive end to both World War Two and Japanese imperial rule across large swaths of Asia – has been well-documented over the past eight decades.Less well-known is the fact that about 20% of the immediate victims were Koreans.Korea had been a Japanese colony for 35 years when the bomb was dropped. An estimated 140,000 Koreans were living in Hiroshima at the time - many having moved there due to forced labour mobilisation, or to survive under colonial exploitation.Those who survived the atom bomb, along with their descendants, continue to live in the long shadow of that day – wrestling with disfigurement, pain, and a decades-long fight for justice that remains unresolved.\n",
      "\"No-one takes responsibility,\" says Shim Jin-tae, an 83-year-old survivor. \"Not the country that dropped the bomb. Not the country that failed to protect us. America never apologised. Japan pretends not to know. Korea is no better. They just pass the blame - and we're left alone.\"Mr Shim now lives in Hapcheon, South Korea: a small county which, having become the home of dozens of survivors like he and Ms Lee, has been dubbed \"Korea's Hiroshima\".For Ms Lee, the shock of that day has not faded  - it etched itself into her body as illness. She now lives with skin cancer, Parkinson's disease, and angina, a condition stemming from poor blood flow to the heart, which typically manifests as chest pain.But what weighs more heavily is that the pain didn't stop with her. Her son Ho-chang, who supports her, was diagnosed with kidney failure and is undergoing dialysis while awaiting a transplant.\"I believe it's due to radiation exposure, but who can prove it?\" Ho-chang Lee says. \"It's hard to verify scientifically - you'd need genetic testing, which is exhausting and expensive.\"The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) told the BBC that it had gathered genetic data between 2020 and 2024 and would continue further studies until 2029. It would \"consider expanding the definition of victims\" to second- and- third-generation survivors only \"if the results are statistically significant\", it said.\n",
      "Of the 140,000 Koreans in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, many were from Hapcheon.Surrounded by mountains with little farmland, it was a difficult place to live. Crops were seized by the Japanese occupiers, droughts ravaged the land, and thousands of people left the rural country for Japan during the war. Some were forcibly conscripted; others were lured by the promise that \"you could eat three meals a day and send your kids to school.\"But in Japan, Koreans were second-class citizens – often given the hardest, dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. Mr Shim says his father worked in a munitions factory as a forced labourer, while his mother hammered nails into wooden ammunition crates.In the aftermath of the bomb, this distribution of labour translated into dangerous and often fatal work for Koreans in Hiroshima.\n",
      "\"Korean workers had to clean up the dead,\" Mr Shim, who is the director of the Hapcheon branch of the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, tells BBC Korean. \"At first they used stretchers, but there were too many bodies. Eventually, they used dustpans to gather corpses and burned them in schoolyards.\"It was mostly Koreans who did this. Most of the post-war clean-up and munitions work was done by us.\"According to a study by the Gyeonggi Welfare Foundation, some survivors were forced to clear rubble and recover bodies. While Japanese evacuees fled to relatives, Koreans without local ties remained in the city, exposed to the radioactive fallout – and with  limited access to medical care.A combination of these conditions - poor treatment, hazardous work and structural discrimination - all contributed to a disproportionately high death toll among Koreans.According to the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, the Korean fatality rate was  57.1%, compared to the overall rate of about 33.7%.About 70,000 Koreans were exposed to the bomb. By year's end, some 40,000 had died.\n",
      "After the bombings, which led to Japan's surrender and Korea's subsequent liberation, about 23,000 Korean survivors returned home. But they were not welcomed. Branded as disfigured or cursed, they faced prejudice even in their homeland.\"Hapcheon already had a leper colony,\" Mr Shim explains. \"And because of that image, people thought the bomb survivors had skin diseases too.\"Such stigma made survivors stay silent about their plight, he adds, suggesting that \"survival came before pride\".Ms Lee says she saw this \"with her own eyes\".\"People who were badly burned or extremely poor were treated terribly,\" she recalls. \"In our village, some people had their backs and faces so badly scarred that only their eyes were visible. They were rejected from marriage and shunned.\"With stigma came poverty, and hardship. Then came illnesses with no clear cause: skin diseases, heart conditions, kidney failure, cancer. The symptoms were everywhere - but no-one could explain them.Over time, the focus shifted to the second and third generations.\n",
      "Han Jeong-sun, a second-generation survivor, suffers from avascular necrosis in her hips, and can't walk without dragging herself. Her first son was born with cerebral palsy.\"My son has never walked a single step in his life,\" she says. \"And my in-laws treated me horribly. They said, 'You gave birth to a crippled child and you're crippled too—are you here to ruin our family?'\"That time was absolute hell.\"For decades, not even the Korean government took active interest in its own victims, as a war with the North and economic struggles were treated as higher priorities.It wasn't until 2019 - more than 70 years after the bombing - that MOHW released its first fact-finding report. That survey was mostly based on questionnaires.In response to BBC inquiries, the ministry explained that prior to 2019, \"There was no legal basis for funding or official investigations\".But two separate studies had found that second-generation victims were more vulnerable to illness. One, from 2005, showed that second-generation victims were far more likely than the general population to suffer depression, heart disease and anaemia, while another from 2013 found their disability registration rate was nearly double the national average.Against this backdrop, Ms Han is incredulous that authorities keep asking for proof to recognise her and her son as victims of Hiroshima.\"My illness is the proof. My son's disability is the proof. This pain passes down generations, and it's visible,\" she says. \"But they won't recognise it. So what are we supposed to do - just die without ever being acknowledged?\"\n",
      "It was only last month, on 12 July, that Hiroshima officials visited Hapcheon for the first time to lay flowers at a memorial. While former PM Yukio Hatoyama and other private figures had come before, this was the first official visit by current Japanese officials.\"Now in 2025 Japan talks about peace. But peace without apology is meaningless,\" says Junko Ichiba, a long-time Japanese peace activist who has spent most of her life advocating for Korean Hiroshima victims.She points out that the visiting officials gave no mention or apology for how Japan treated Korean people before and during World War Two.\n",
      "Although multiple former Japanese leaders have offered their apologies and remorse, many South Koreans regard these sentiments as insincere or insufficient without formal acknowledgement.Ms Ichiba notes  that Japanese textbooks still omit the history of Korea's colonial past - as well as its atomic bomb victims – saying that \"this invisibility only deepens the injustice\".This  adds to what many view as a broader lack of accountability for Japan's colonial legacy.Heo Jeong-gu, director of the Red Cross's support division, said, \"These issues... must be addressed while survivors are still alive. For the second and third generations, we must gather evidence and testimonies before it's too late.\"For survivors like Mr Shim it's not just about being compensated – it's about being acknowledged.\"Memory matters more than compensation,\" he says. \"Our bodies remember what we went through… If we forget, it'll happen again. And someday, there'll be no one left to tell the story.\"...\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3791ep6gko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 More than £100m of premium bond prizes remain unclaimed amid criticism that the government-owned bank which operates the savings scheme is not doing enough to find the winners.Among the 2.5 million unclaimed prizes are 11 winners of £100,000 - the second-largest prize available.Critics say the process to trace accounts needs reform as it is too difficult for people gifted Premium Bonds, or those who only ever had paper records.Operator National Savings and Investments (NS&I) said it had paid more than 99% of the prize-winners since starting its tax-free draws in 1957.\n",
      "Wills and probate solicitor Patrice Lawrence said she had helped seven people trace accounts including clients, and friends and family.\"It's shocking that a government-owned bank is sitting on nearly £100m [in unclaimed prizes] that doesn't belong to it during a cost of living crisis,\" she told the BBC.Premiums Bonds are a lottery-style, government-backed savings account where people can put money in and take it out when they want.The amount of interest paid in return for each £1 bond is decided by a monthly prize draw, with some holders receiving nothing and others getting prizes from £25 all the way up to a £1m jackpot.NS&I said every jackpot millionaire had received their money.\n",
      "Since the first draw in June 1957, its Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment - known as ERNIE - has drawn a total of 772 million prizes worth a combined £37bn.Premium Bonds prize winners should receive notifications of their winnings via text message, email or post if they have registered their details.Some customers, however, relocate and forget to update their details.Other bond holdings are not registered.  For example, people may be unaware they were gifted bonds as children, or they were never given the paper certificate carrying the account numbers.NS&I retail director Andrew Westhead said the bank recognised bonds purchased before digitisation were \"much harder to trace\".\n",
      "Nearly 23 million people had Premium Bonds accounts worth a combined £130bn, as of the end of March 2025.NS&I originally contacted winners by post and sent cheques, but since 2011 holders could choose to have prizes paid directly into a bank account or reinvested in more bonds.The oldest unclaimed prize was £25 won in November 1957 in South Yorkshire.Mr Westhead said: \"The £103m of prizes currently unclaimed represents just 0.28% of the total £37bn awarded by ERNIE over nearly seven decades.\"He said the bank provided information online and through its call centre on how to claim winnings, publicised details of unclaimed prizes and encouraged customers to use its prize checker.People can also use its tracing service to track down mislaid bonds, he said.NS&I also said that, as of the end of March 2025, it had been asked to carry out 781,576 traces.Of those, 465,048 were successful, and 443,806 accounts had been found with value. The bank could not say how many of those people had their original paperwork.\n",
      "Melanie Clarke did not initially know what was in front of her when she found premium bond papers among her late father Hugo's affairs.Her mother explained some were a gift for her and her sister, while some remained in her parents' names.She said: \"They're quite delicate and flimsy…[I thought of the papers] what part of that is important? How do I found out any information about this?\"Mr Clarke first came from Trinidad to the UK as an RAF Serviceman, aged 19,  as part of the so-called Windrush generation.He did not leave a will when he died from natural causes related to vascular dementia in 2018.While clearing his possessions Ms Clarke misplaced the paperwork, and is now in a weeks-long exchange with NS&I trying to trace the accounts.She believes many people of her generation would have been bought Premium Bonds when they were children, but will have little idea how to trace their accounts.Sam Richardson, deputy editor at consumer group Which? Money, said NS&I was not signed up to the government's own Tell Us Once service or its private equivalent, the Death Notification Service. The schemes help bereaved people by simplifying the process of notifying multiple organisations after a death.The bank said its services \"often required more individualised contact with executors\" than the Tell Us Once scheme, but it wanted to be \"as easy to use as possible... during difficult events\".\n",
      "BBC Morning Live's resident money expert Iona Bain said NS&I needed to consider how it could improve.\"In theory, it shouldn't be the end of the world if you don't have the original certificate, perhaps because they've been mislaid or damaged,\" she said.\"NS&I encourages people to come forward even if they only have basic details, as these can be matched up with what's in the system.\"But the reality is more complicated. The majority of traces may be successful, but too many people have been left unhappy with what they feel is a 'computer says no' approach, even when they believe they have most of the details needed to find a match.\"Whilst it can be administratively complex to track down historic money, NS&I needs to consider how it can improve this process so it's much less rigid, bureaucratic and frankly disappointing.\"\n",
      "Miss Lawrence has begun a petition calling for reform so names, dates of birth and address at time of purchase would be enough to locate an account.Other difficulties she has highlighted include:a lack of awareness about premium bonds paperwork when it is found among a relative's possessions after they have diedpeople who had paper bonds bought for them when they were minors not being aware they had to take steps to have the bonds transferred to them when they reach 16people finding bond certificates that have a holder's number, date and location of purchase, but the NS&I being unable to tell them to whom they belong\n",
      "NS&I'stracing servicecan be contacted online, by post or over the phone, if people do not have their bond number or NS&I number.They can also useMyLostAccountwhich is associated with UK Finance and the Building Societies Association, and can be used to trace old accounts with other providers as well as NS&I.People with original paper bonds such as those purchased over the counter at the Post Office can register them online or call the helpline on 08085 007 007.A request can also be made for a trace by someone who is legally entitled to act on someone else's behalf, for example under a Power of Attorney or by an executor of a will.\n",

      "📰 **He is a human skeleton, Gaza hostage's brother tells BBC**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewyk4ezeedo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The brother of an Israeli hostage held in the Gaza Strip has told the BBC that a Hamas video showing him emaciated and weak is a \"new form of cruelty\" that has left his parents shattered.Hamas released the footage of Evyatar David, 24, on Saturday, drawing strong condemnation from Israel and Western leaders.\"He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment, and he suffers a great deal. He barely can't speak, he barely can move,\" David's brother Ilay said in an interview on Monday.In the video, Evyatar says: \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water.\" He is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.\n",
      "Hostages' families have urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritise their release as reports suggest he might be planning to expand the military campaign.The footage of Evyatar was released after Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of another hostage, Rom Braslavski, thin and crying.Both men were abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.They are among 50 hostages still being held in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.Ilay David said his father had barely recognised his son Evyatar's voice on the video and had not been able to sleep. He said his mother cried all day.\"Seeing those images of my brother as a human skeleton, we understood it's, it's, it's a new kind of cruelty,\" Mr David said. \"It's the lowest you can get.\"He called on world leaders to unite to save him and other hostages \"from the cruel, twisted hands of Hamas\".\"So we have to be so focused on delivering the message, which is, Evyatar is dying, we need to give him medicine, to give him food, proper food, and you need to get this treatment now, or else will die.\"Hamas's armed wing has denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people in Gaza eat.\n",
      "After the hostages' videos were released, Netanyahu spoke with their families, telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".But an Israeli official - widely quoted by local media - said Netanyahu was working to free the hostages through \"the military defeat of Hamas\".The possibility of a new escalation in Gaza may further anger Israel's allies who have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire as reports of Palestinians dying from starvation or malnutrition cause shock around the world.The main group supporting hostages' families condemned the idea of a new military offensive saying: \"Netanyahu is leading Israel and the hostages to doom.\"That view was pointedly made in a letter by some 600 retired Israeli security officials sent to US President Donald Trump urging him to pressure Israel to immediately end the war in Gaza.\"Your credibility with the vast majority of Israelis augments your ability to steer Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and his government in the right direction: End the war, return the hostages, stop the suffering,\" they wrote.The group included former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, Ami Ayalon, former chief of Shin Bet - Israel's domestic secret service agency - former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and former Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon among others.\"It is our professional judgement that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,\" they said.\"At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,\" said Ayalon.The former top leaders head the Commanders for Israel's Security (CIS) group, which has urged the government in the past to focus on securing the return of the hostages.\"Stop the Gaza War! On behalf of CIS, Israel's largest group of former IDF generals and Mossad, Shin Bet, Police, and Diplomatic Corps equivalents, we urge you to end the Gaza war. You did it in Lebanon. Time to do it in Gaza as well,\" they wrote to the US president.\n",
      "Israel launched a devastating war in Gaza following Hamas's 7 October attack in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken into Gaza as hostages.More than 60,000 people have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza since 7 October, the Hamas-run health ministry says.On Monday, the ministry reported that at least 94 people had been killed in Gaza in the past day, including dozens it said had died in Israeli strikes.The territory is also experiencing mass deprivation as a result of heavy restrictions imposed by Israel on what is allowed into Gaza. The ministry says 180 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition since the start of the war.Such reports have become almost daily in recent months but are hard to verify as international journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza.UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza....\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mHere are the summaries of the latest 7 news items:\n",
