      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjy29zql25o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Victims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.The Supreme Court ruled on Fridaythat hidden commissions from lenders to dealers on car loans were not unlawful, meaning millions of motorists will not be able to claim.However, the judgement left open the possibility of compensation claims for particularly large commissions which the Supreme Court said were unfair.Following the ruling, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme - estimated to cost between £9bn and £18bn.\n",
      "The FCA said it was \"hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme\", but it is understood that millions could be eligible.The industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs.Those who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company.It added that it \"anticipate[s] requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do\" and that claims \"should cover agreements dating back to 2007\".However, the Finance & Leasing Association has said it is concerned \"about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information\".The FCA said it will start its consultation on who should be eligible for compensation and how much they should get in October, adding that the Supreme Court ruling provided \"clarity\".On Friday, the Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful.The case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa's FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won a Court of Appeal case in October.However, the Supreme Court ruled that if commission is extremely high, such as in the case brought by Marcus Johnson, where the commission paid to the dealer was 55% of the total charge or credit including interest and fees - that this was a \"powerful indication\" the relationship between Mr Johnson and lender FirstRand was unfair.The Supreme Court awarded Mr Johnson the amount of a commission plus interest.The FCA said Friday's judgement \"helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts\".FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: \"It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\"\n",
      "The issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \"if they were not properly disclosed\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\"....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\" and they must be released \"unconditionally\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\n",
      "Both Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.\n",
      "In the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\".\n",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \"appalled\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \"abject cruelty\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\n",

      "📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The sheet of paper says \"Wanted Person\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\n",
      "The new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\n",
      "China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\n",
      "In 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\n",
      "\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\" she says.\n",
      "Steve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\".\n",
      "There is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\n",
      "This has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\" he says.\n",
      "However, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"\n",
      "At the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\" he says.\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\n",
      "But Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\".\n",
      "China's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\n",
      "Since then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \"golden era\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\" he argues.\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\"\n",
      "Lord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \"continued tension\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\n",
      "\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\" says Lord Ricketts. \"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\"\n",
      "The Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\" he argues, \"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\" he says.But, equally, \"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\n",
      "How do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\n",
      "The storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \"unusually strong\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\n",
      "The area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\n",
      "Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\"She added: \"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\"\n",
      "Named storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\n",
      "The storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\"\n",

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists.

Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\"\n",

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers,\\\" it said.The Oasis concert on Sunday went ahead as planned.The band will next appear in Edinburgh for three gigs on 8, 9 and 12 August and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September....\\n\\n📰 **Amber warning issued ahead of Storm Floris**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\\nHow do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\\nThe storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \\\"unusually strong\\\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\",\n",

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers,\\\" it said.The Oasis concert on Sunday went ahead as planned.The band will next appear in Edinburgh for three gigs on 8, 9 and 12 August and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September....\\n\\n📰 **Amber warning issued ahead of Storm Floris**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\\nHow do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\\nThe storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \\\"unusually strong\\\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\",\n",

This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers,\\\" it said.The Oasis concert on Sunday went ahead as planned.The band will next appear in Edinburgh for three gigs on 8, 9 and 12 August and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September....\\n\\n📰 **Amber warning issued ahead of Storm Floris**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\\nHow do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\\nThe storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \\\"unusually strong\\\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\\nHuman: {user_input}\"\n",

      "📄 Victims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.The Supreme Court ruled on Fridaythat hidden commissions from lenders to dealers on car loans were not unlawful, meaning millions of motorists will not be able to claim.However, the judgement left open the possibility of compensation claims for particularly large commissions which the Supreme Court said were unfair.Following the ruling, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme - estimated to cost between £9bn and £18bn.\n",
      "The FCA said it was \"hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme\", but it is understood that millions could be eligible.The industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs.Those who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company.It added that it \"anticipate[s] requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do\" and that claims \"should cover agreements dating back to 2007\".However, the Finance & Leasing Association has said it is concerned \"about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information\".The FCA said it will start its consultation on who should be eligible for compensation and how much they should get in October, adding that the Supreme Court ruling provided \"clarity\".On Friday, the Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful.The case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa's FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won a Court of Appeal case in October.However, the Supreme Court ruled that if commission is extremely high, such as in the case brought by Marcus Johnson, where the commission paid to the dealer was 55% of the total charge or credit including interest and fees - that this was a \"powerful indication\" the relationship between Mr Johnson and lender FirstRand was unfair.The Supreme Court awarded Mr Johnson the amount of a commission plus interest.The FCA said Friday's judgement \"helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts\".FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: \"It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\"\n",
      "The issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \"if they were not properly disclosed\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\"....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\" and they must be released \"unconditionally\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\n",
      "Both Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.\n",
      "In the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\".\n",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \"appalled\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \"abject cruelty\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\n",

      "📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The sheet of paper says \"Wanted Person\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\n",
      "The new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\n",
      "China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\n",
      "In 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\n",
      "\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\" she says.\n",
      "Steve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\".\n",
      "There is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\n",
      "This has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\" he says.\n",
      "However, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"\n",
      "At the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\" he says.\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\n",
      "But Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\".\n",
      "China's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\n",
      "Since then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \"golden era\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\" he argues.\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\"\n",
      "Lord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \"continued tension\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\n",
      "\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\" says Lord Ricketts. \"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\"\n",
      "The Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\" he argues, \"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\" he says.But, equally, \"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\n",

      "📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\n",
      "How do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\n",
      "The storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \"unusually strong\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\n",
      "The area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\n",
      "Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\"She added: \"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\"\n",
      "Named storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\n",

      "📄 A massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi has been blamed by Moscow on an overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Krasnodar region Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said drone debris hit a fuel tank and 127 firefighters were on Sunday tackling the blaze, which was later put out.The airport near Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games - briefly suspended flights.Meanwhile, Russia again bombed a key bridge in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, killing one man, local officials said. In nearby Mykolaiv, seven people were injured and several homes destroyed.Ukraine earlier reported seven deaths in Saturday's Russian attacks in the Kherson and eastern Donetsk regions.\n",
      "Russian authorities said the drone attack on the Sochi refinery was one of several launched by Ukraine over the weekend.They said installations were targeted in the central Russian cities of Ryazan, Penza, as well as Voronezh - not far from the border with Ukraine. The Voronezh regional governor said four people were injured in one drone strike.Ukraine has not commented on the strikes. It has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation to Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid throughout the war.Russia's defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, 60 of which were over the Black Sea region.Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 83 drones or 76 drones and seven missiles overnight, 61 of which were shot down. It added that 16 drones and six missiles struck targets in eight locations.\n",
      "In the city of Kherson, regional head Oleksandr Prokudin called for a partial evacuation after the key Ostrivsky bridge was again hit on Sunday morning.The bridge linking the Korabel island district with the rest of the city had already been badly damaged in Russian strikes earlier this week. Some 1,800 people still live in the district.The new Russian strikes come after a particularly deadly week for civilians in Ukraine, including anattack on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 31 people.More than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Ukrainian officials said, making the attack one of the deadliest on the capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger international sanctions on Russia this week, while US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports.On Monday, Trump set a new \"10 or 12\" day deadline.

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn5e70v7lqqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Fifth Rothesay Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five)India 224(Nair 57, Atkinson 5-33, Tongue 3-57) &396(Jaiswal 118; Tongue 5-125)England 247(Crawley 64; Krishna 4-62, Siraj 4-86) &339-6(Brook 111, Root 105)England need 35 runs to win; India need four wicketsScorecard\n",
      "England need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light.In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play.Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale.Brook, on 111, lost his bat in miscuing Akash Deep to mid-off, Jacob Bethell was bowled attempting a wild hack and a poking Root was caught behind for 105.Jamie Overton joined Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith on their home ground with 37 required. Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.Both Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.Overton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2. The outcome is on a knife-edge.\n",
      "After seven weeks of drama, needle and outstanding cricket, perhaps it is only fitting that this memorable series will decided on the last possible day.Both sides might feel that this Test should already be won. That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.England fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.That India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.If anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away.There is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\n",
      "From 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.But Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.Brook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.Brook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.A dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.Bethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.Nerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\n",
      "Perhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.India left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.For so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.Smith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.The review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.The crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\n",
      "England batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:\"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same. We are in for a cracker for tomorrow. It will be a great finish.\"On his headband tribute to Graham Thorpe:\"I wish I had it in my pocket from the start. I put it there at tea. He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room. It is great to see everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people.\"...\n",

      "📰 **'I'm in control of my sexual health' - UK gonorrhoea vaccine rollout begins**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrx6dnkkeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Gonorrhoea vaccines will be widely available from today in sexual health clinics across the UK, in a bid to tackle record-breaking levels of infections.The jabs will first be offered to those at highest risk - mostly gay and bisexual men who have a history of multiple sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections.NHS England say the roll out is a world-first, and predict it could prevent as many as 100,000 cases, potentially saving the NHS almost £8m over the next decade.The Terrence Higgins Trust, whocampaigned for the vaccineto be introduced in the UK, told the BBC it was \"a huge win\" for sexual health.\n",
      "Gonorrhoea is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through unprotected sex.Symptoms can include pain, unusual discharge, inflammation of the genitals and infertility, but in some cases it can have no symptoms at all.The NHS saysit can be avoidedby the proper use of condoms and by accepting the vaccine if offered.Doctorsare becoming increasingly worriedabout the number of infections, and hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will also help slow thegrowing number of antibiotic-resistant cases.The vaccine, known as the 4CMenB vaccine, was designed for preventing meningitis B in babies, but the bacteria that causes the two diseases are so closely related that the jab is also effective against gonorrhoea.There were more than 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea in 2023 - the highest since records began almost 100 years ago.One of those diagnosed was Joey Knock, who says the infection gave him diarrhoea, made him feel \"wiped out\" and led to him taking time off work to recover.He told BBC News: \"I discussed it with my friends and I definitely had worse symptoms [than them] with it.\"I felt really bad, I couldn't keep food down and I just felt totally run down.\"\n",
      "Because he has many sexual partners, the 35-year-old decided to pay a private pharmacy for a course of gonorrhoea vaccinations in February 2024 before travelling abroad to a festival.He paid £220 and says he's glad he did it.\"It helps knowing that I'm taking control of my sexual health and doing what I can to stay safe and practise safer sex and be much less worried about the severity of the symptoms,\" he says.Joey says he uses the protection the vaccine offers him alongside other methods of safer sex, including taking PrEP, a drug which helps prevent HIV, and DoxyPep - antibiotics taken after sex to prevent bacterial STIs, a treatment not widely available on the NHS.He says he also occasionally uses condoms - but sees the vaccine as an extra tool to keep him safe in situations where he or his partner doesn't want to use them.Since being vaccinated, Joey has been re-infected with gonorrhoea but says the symptoms were much less severe.He told the BBC: \"I've been able to get on with my day and it has just become something much more manageable, and getting tested regularly and knowing my body really helps too.\"\n",
      "Matthew, a 63-year-old from East Scotland, was diagnosed with gonorrhoea 10 years ago and had a reaction known asreactive arthritis- extreme pain in your joints caused by your body's reaction to an infection.He told the BBC that the experience, which has caused lasting damage to some of his fingers and toes, was so painful it's left him fearful of becoming re-infected and has impacted his mental health.He says: \"I'm constantly looking for symptoms and I'm constantly aware of it, and I feel a bit like I used to do in the 1980s when I was constantly fretting about HIV.\"I'd get some sort of cough and think 'oh my god, what's happening?'\"He is hoping to be one of the first people to get a vaccine in order to give himself and his sexual partners more protection.\"You're not just protecting yourself, you're protecting your partners.\"I think it will also relieve some of the burden on sexual health services, it's getting difficult to get appointments so if it can work to reduce the incidence of STIs I think it's really worth it.\"Richard Angell, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading sexual health charity, told the BBC the vaccine was a \"remarkable addition to our toolkit on sexual health\".Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS national director for primary care and community services, said it was important \"everyone eligible takes up the offer through sexual health services\" in order to \"keep each other safe\".\"It's a real step forward for sexual health,\" she added.People who may be eligible for the vaccine are being asked to contacttheir local sexual health clinicfor more information....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e641p41po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Plans to evacuate more seriously ill or injured children from Gaza and bring them to the UK for medical treatment are being carried out \"at pace\", the government says.The BBC understands the aim is to bring the plan into operation within weeks.It is unclear how many children might be involved, butthe Sunday Times reportsthe government is to allow up to 300 young people to enter the UK to receive free medical care.Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.\n",
      "A government spokesperson said on Sunday the plan was to \"evacuate children from Gaza who require urgent medical care,\" adding \"we are working at pace to do so as quickly as possible.\"More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the war in Gaza begun in October 2023,according to the UN charity Unicef.A Foreign Affairs Committee report published at the end of July said the government had \"declined to support a medical evacuation of critically injured children to the UK, involving coordinating travel permits, medical visas and safe transport to the UK, where the children can receive specialised care unavailable to them in Gaza\".Following that, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \"urgently accelerating efforts\" to evacuate children who needed critical medical assistance to the UK for treatment.According to the Sunday Times, the government scheme will require a parent or guardian to accompany each child, and the Home Office will carry out biometric and security checks before they travel.\n",
      "Gazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuriesGazan girls arrive in UK for medical treatment\n",
      "Project Pure Hope, a British organisation which includes volunteer medical professionals, has so far brought three children to the UK for treatment.The most recent, 15-year-old Majd al-Shagnobi, arrived in the UK last week. He required complex facial reconstructive surgery after an Israeli tank shell destroyed his jaw when he was trying to access aid in February 2024. He was the first Palestinian child to be flown to the UK for treatment for war injuries.His evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.His treatment, privately funded by Project Pure Hope, will begin at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the coming days, carried out by a medical team who will all work for free.The organisation has been urging the government to establish a scheme similar to one created to treat Ukrainian refugees and welcomed the government's plan, saying it would be able to share its expertise from successful private evacuations.It said: \"Our blueprint can help ensure the UK acts quickly and effectively, so that every child who needs urgent care has the best chance of survival and recovery.\"\n",
      "In April, the group secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - to have privately funded operations in the UK for life-long medical conditions.They were brought to London after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza.Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing. And Rama has had exploratory surgery for a serious bowel condition.Their mothers say both girls are doing well.\n",
      "Medics have been warning of shortages in vital food and medical supplies for weeks, after Israel began a months-long blockade of all aid and goods into Gaza.This has since been partially lifted, but humanitarian agencies have said more aid must be allowed to enter to Gaza to prevent famine and malnutrition worsening.The Hamas-run health ministry said 175 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition.Israel denies it is deliberately blocking aid flowing into Gaza and accuses the UN and other aid agencies of failing to deliver it.Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region, and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory.Sir Keir said last week that theUK would recognise a Palestinian state in Septemberunless Israel took \"substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza\" - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism\".\n",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 60,000 people have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjxg65p56o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and prayed there, violating a decades-old arrangement covering one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East.Photos and videos of his visit show Ben-Gvir leading Jewish prayers at the compound, which is known by Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem.Praying at the site breaks a long-time arrangement that allows Jews to visit the site but not pray.The Israeli prime minister's office released a statement saying there had been no change to Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.\n",
      "Jordan, custodian of the site, called Ben-Gvir's latest visit \"an unacceptable provocation\".Hamas called it \"a deepening of the ongoing aggressions against our Palestinian people\", while a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the visit \"crossed all red lines\".The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which runs the site, said Ben-Gvir was among 1,250 Jews who ascended the compound on Sunday morning.Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist who as national security minister oversees the police, hasvisited the site before, but the Times of Israel reported this was the first time that he openly prayed at the site.He was flanked by police officers while entering and touring the compound.In a statement at the site, Ben-Gvir said \"horror\" video of hostages recently released by Hamas, in which they appear emaciated, were aimed at putting pressure on Israel, and called for the hostages' return.The minister also repeated his call for Israel to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip and to encourage what he described as \"voluntary emigration\" of Palestinians from the territory.Experts say this would amount to the forced displacement of civilians, and a possible war crime.He hasbeen sanctioned by the UKfor \"repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities\" in the occupied West Bank....\"\n",

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers,\\\" it said.The Oasis concert on Sunday went ahead as planned.The band will next appear in Edinburgh for three gigs on 8, 9 and 12 August and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September....\\n\\n📰 **Amber warning issued ahead of Storm Floris**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\\nHow do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\\nThe storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \\\"unusually strong\\\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\\n\\n📰 **Ukraine drone attack causes fire at Sochi oil depot, Russia says**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglyv396ppo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 A massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi has been blamed by Moscow on an overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Krasnodar region Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said drone debris hit a fuel tank and 127 firefighters were on Sunday tackling the blaze, which was later put out.The airport near Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games - briefly suspended flights.Meanwhile, Russia again bombed a key bridge in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, killing one man, local officials said. In nearby Mykolaiv, seven people were injured and several homes destroyed.Ukraine earlier reported seven deaths in Saturday's Russian attacks in the Kherson and eastern Donetsk regions.\\nRussian authorities said the drone attack on the Sochi refinery was one of several launched by Ukraine over the weekend.They said installations were targeted in the central Russian cities of Ryazan, Penza, as well as Voronezh - not far from the border with Ukraine. The Voronezh regional governor said four people were injured in one drone strike.Ukraine has not commented on the strikes. It has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation to Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid throughout the war.Russia's defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, 60 of which were over the Black Sea region.Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 83 drones or 76 drones and seven missiles overnight, 61 of which were shot down. It added that 16 drones and six missiles struck targets in eight locations.\\nIn the city of Kherson, regional head Oleksandr Prokudin called for a partial evacuation after the key Ostrivsky bridge was again hit on Sunday morning.The bridge linking the Korabel island district with the rest of the city had already been badly damaged in Russian strikes earlier this week. Some 1,800 people still live in the district.The new Russian strikes come after a particularly deadly week for civilians in Ukraine, including anattack on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 31 people.More than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Ukrainian officials said, making the attack one of the deadliest on the capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger international sanctions on Russia this week, while US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports.On Monday, Trump set a new \\\"10 or 12\\\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August....\\n\\n📰 **England need 35 to win astonishing final Test**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn5e70v7lqqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Fifth Rothesay Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five)India 224(Nair 57, Atkinson 5-33, Tongue 3-57) &396(Jaiswal 118; Tongue 5-125)England 247(Crawley 64; Krishna 4-62, Siraj 4-86) &339-6(Brook 111, Root 105)England need 35 runs to win; India need four wicketsScorecard\\nEngland need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light.In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play.Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale.Brook, on 111, lost his bat in miscuing Akash Deep to mid-off, Jacob Bethell was bowled attempting a wild hack and a poking Root was caught behind for 105.Jamie Overton joined Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith on their home ground with 37 required. Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.Both Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.Overton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2. The outcome is on a knife-edge.\\nAfter seven weeks of drama, needle and outstanding cricket, perhaps it is only fitting that this memorable series will decided on the last possible day.Both sides might feel that this Test should already be won. That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.England fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.That India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.If anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away.There is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\\nFrom 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.But Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.Brook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.Brook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.A dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.Bethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.Nerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\\nPerhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.India left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.For so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.Smith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.The review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.The crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\\nEngland batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:\\\"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same. We are in for a cracker for tomorrow. It will be a great finish.\\\"On his headband tribute to Graham Thorpe:\\\"I wish I had it in my pocket from the start. I put it there at tea. He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\\\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room. It is great to see everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people.\\\"...\\n\\n📰 **'I'm in control of my sexual health' - UK gonorrhoea vaccine rollout begins**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrx6dnkkeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Gonorrhoea vaccines will be widely available from today in sexual health clinics across the UK, in a bid to tackle record-breaking levels of infections.The jabs will first be offered to those at highest risk - mostly gay and bisexual men who have a history of multiple sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections.NHS England say the roll out is a world-first, and predict it could prevent as many as 100,000 cases, potentially saving the NHS almost £8m over the next decade.The Terrence Higgins Trust, whocampaigned for the vaccineto be introduced in the UK, told the BBC it was \\\"a huge win\\\" for sexual health.\\nGonorrhoea is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through unprotected sex.Symptoms can include pain, unusual discharge, inflammation of the genitals and infertility, but in some cases it can have no symptoms at all.The NHS saysit can be avoidedby the proper use of condoms and by accepting the vaccine if offered.Doctorsare becoming increasingly worriedabout the number of infections, and hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will also help slow thegrowing number of antibiotic-resistant cases.The vaccine, known as the 4CMenB vaccine, was designed for preventing meningitis B in babies, but the bacteria that causes the two diseases are so closely related that the jab is also effective against gonorrhoea.There were more than 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea in 2023 - the highest since records began almost 100 years ago.One of those diagnosed was Joey Knock, who says the infection gave him diarrhoea, made him feel \\\"wiped out\\\" and led to him taking time off work to recover.He told BBC News: \\\"I discussed it with my friends and I definitely had worse symptoms [than them] with it.\\\"I felt really bad, I couldn't keep food down and I just felt totally run down.\\\"\\nBecause he has many sexual partners, the 35-year-old decided to pay a private pharmacy for a course of gonorrhoea vaccinations in February 2024 before travelling abroad to a festival.He paid £220 and says he's glad he did it.\\\"It helps knowing that I'm taking control of my sexual health and doing what I can to stay safe and practise safer sex and be much less worried about the severity of the symptoms,\\\" he says.Joey says he uses the protection the vaccine offers him alongside other methods of safer sex, including taking PrEP, a drug which helps prevent HIV, and DoxyPep - antibiotics taken after sex to prevent bacterial STIs, a treatment not widely available on the NHS.He says he also occasionally uses condoms - but sees the vaccine as an extra tool to keep him safe in situations where he or his partner doesn't want to use them.Since being vaccinated, Joey has been re-infected with gonorrhoea but says the symptoms were much less severe.He told the BBC: \\\"I've been able to get on with my day and it has just become something much more manageable, and getting tested regularly and knowing my body really helps too.\\\"\\nMatthew, a 63-year-old from East Scotland, was diagnosed with gonorrhoea 10 years ago and had a reaction known asreactive arthritis- extreme pain in your joints caused by your body's reaction to an infection.He told the BBC that the experience, which has caused lasting damage to some of his fingers and toes, was so painful it's left him fearful of becoming re-infected and has impacted his mental health.He says: \\\"I'm constantly looking for symptoms and I'm constantly aware of it, and I feel a bit like I used to do in the 1980s when I was constantly fretting about HIV.\\\"I'd get some sort of cough and think 'oh my god, what's happening?'\\\"He is hoping to be one of the first people to get a vaccine in order to give himself and his sexual partners more protection.\\\"You're not just protecting yourself, you're protecting your partners.\\\"I think it will also relieve some of the burden on sexual health services, it's getting difficult to get appointments so if it can work to reduce the incidence of STIs I think it's really worth it.\\\"Richard Angell, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading sexual health charity, told the BBC the vaccine was a \\\"remarkable addition to our toolkit on sexual health\\\".Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS national director for primary care and community services, said it was important \\\"everyone eligible takes up the offer through sexual health services\\\" in order to \\\"keep each other safe\\\".\\\"It's a real step forward for sexual health,\\\" she added.People who may be eligible for the vaccine are being asked to contacttheir local sexual health clinicfor more information....\\n\\n📰 **Government plans to bring more Gazan children to UK for treatment**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e641p41po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Plans to evacuate more seriously ill or injured children from Gaza and bring them to the UK for medical treatment are being carried out \\\"at pace\\\", the government says.The BBC understands the aim is to bring the plan into operation within weeks.It is unclear how many children might be involved, butthe Sunday Times reportsthe government is to allow up to 300 young people to enter the UK to receive free medical care.Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.\\nA government spokesperson said on Sunday the plan was to \\\"evacuate children from Gaza who require urgent medical care,\\\" adding \\\"we are working at pace to do so as quickly as possible.\\\"More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the war in Gaza begun in October 2023,according to the UN charity Unicef.A Foreign Affairs Committee report published at the end of July said the government had \\\"declined to support a medical evacuation of critically injured children to the UK, involving coordinating travel permits, medical visas and safe transport to the UK, where the children can receive specialised care unavailable to them in Gaza\\\".Following that, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \\\"urgently accelerating efforts\\\" to evacuate children who needed critical medical assistance to the UK for treatment.According to the Sunday Times, the government scheme will require a parent or guardian to accompany each child, and the Home Office will carry out biometric and security checks before they travel.\\nGazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuriesGazan girls arrive in UK for medical treatment\\nProject Pure Hope, a British organisation which includes volunteer medical professionals, has so far brought three children to the UK for treatment.The most recent, 15-year-old Majd al-Shagnobi, arrived in the UK last week. He required complex facial reconstructive surgery after an Israeli tank shell destroyed his jaw when he was trying to access aid in February 2024. He was the first Palestinian child to be flown to the UK for treatment for war injuries.His evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.His treatment, privately funded by Project Pure Hope, will begin at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the coming days, carried out by a medical team who will all work for free.The organisation has been urging the government to establish a scheme similar to one created to treat Ukrainian refugees and welcomed the government's plan, saying it would be able to share its expertise from successful private evacuations.It said: \\\"Our blueprint can help ensure the UK acts quickly and effectively, so that every child who needs urgent care has the best chance of survival and recovery.\\\"\\nIn April, the group secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - to have privately funded operations in the UK for life-long medical conditions.They were brought to London after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza.Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing. And Rama has had exploratory surgery for a serious bowel condition.Their mothers say both girls are doing well.\\nMedics have been warning of shortages in vital food and medical supplies for weeks, after Israel began a months-long blockade of all aid and goods into Gaza.This has since been partially lifted, but humanitarian agencies have said more aid must be allowed to enter to Gaza to prevent famine and malnutrition worsening.The Hamas-run health ministry said 175 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition.Israel denies it is deliberately blocking aid flowing into Gaza and accuses the UN and other aid agencies of failing to deliver it.Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region, and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory.Sir Keir said last week that theUK would recognise a Palestinian state in Septemberunless Israel took \\\"substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza\\\" - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \\\"rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism\\\".\\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 60,000 people have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry....\\n\\n📰 **Israeli minister sparks anger by praying at sensitive Jerusalem holy site**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjxg65p56o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and prayed there, violating a decades-old arrangement covering one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East.Photos and videos of his visit show Ben-Gvir leading Jewish prayers at the compound, which is known by Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem.Praying at the site breaks a long-time arrangement that allows Jews to visit the site but not pray.The Israeli prime minister's office released a statement saying there had been no change to Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.\\nJordan, custodian of the site, called Ben-Gvir's latest visit \\\"an unacceptable provocation\\\".Hamas called it \\\"a deepening of the ongoing aggressions against our Palestinian people\\\", while a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the visit \\\"crossed all red lines\\\".The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which runs the site, said Ben-Gvir was among 1,250 Jews who ascended the compound on Sunday morning.Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist who as national security minister oversees the police, hasvisited the site before, but the Times of Israel reported this was the first time that he openly prayed at the site.He was flanked by police officers while entering and touring the compound.In a statement at the site, Ben-Gvir said \\\"horror\\\" video of hostages recently released by Hamas, in which they appear emaciated, were aimed at putting pressure on Israel, and called for the hostages' return.The minister also repeated his call for Israel to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip and to encourage what he described as \\\"voluntary emigration\\\" of Palestinians from the territory.Experts say this would amount to the forced displacement of civilians, and a possible war crime.He hasbeen sanctioned by the UKfor \\\"repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities\\\" in the occupied West Bank....\"\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjy29zql25o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Victims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.The Supreme Court ruled on Fridaythat hidden commissions from lenders to dealers on car loans were not unlawful, meaning millions of motorists will not be able to claim.However, the judgement left open the possibility of compensation claims for particularly large commissions which the Supreme Court said were unfair.Following the ruling, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme - estimated to cost between £9bn and £18bn.\n",
      "The FCA said it was \"hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme\", but it is understood that millions could be eligible.The industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs.Those who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company.It added that it \"anticipate[s] requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do\" and that claims \"should cover agreements dating back to 2007\".However, the Finance & Leasing Association has said it is concerned \"about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information\".The FCA said it will start its consultation on who should be eligible for compensation and how much they should get in October, adding that the Supreme Court ruling provided \"clarity\".On Friday, the Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful.The case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa's FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won a Court of Appeal case in October.However, the Supreme Court ruled that if commission is extremely high, such as in the case brought by Marcus Johnson, where the commission paid to the dealer was 55% of the total charge or credit including interest and fees - that this was a \"powerful indication\" the relationship between Mr Johnson and lender FirstRand was unfair.The Supreme Court awarded Mr Johnson the amount of a commission plus interest.The FCA said Friday's judgement \"helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts\".FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: \"It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\"\n",
      "The issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \"if they were not properly disclosed\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\"....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\" and they must be released \"unconditionally\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\n",
      "Both Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.\n",
      "In the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\".\n",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \"appalled\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \"abject cruelty\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\n",

      "📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The sheet of paper says \"Wanted Person\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\n",
      "The new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\n",
      "China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\n",
      "In 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\n",
      "\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\" she says.\n",
      "Steve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\".\n",
      "There is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\n",
      "This has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\" he says.\n",
      "However, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"\n",
      "At the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\" he says.\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\n",
      "But Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\".\n",
      "China's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\n",
      "Since then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \"golden era\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\" he argues.\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\"\n",
      "Lord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \"continued tension\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\n",
      "\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\" says Lord Ricketts. \"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\"\n",
      "The Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\" he argues, \"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\" he says.But, equally, \"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\n",

      "📄 A man has died after falling from a height at an Oasis concert on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police has said.Police said officers and medics at Wembley Stadium in London responded to reports that a man in his 40s had been injured at 22:19 BST.The man \"was found with injuries consistent with a fall\" and was pronounced dead at the scene, a spokesperson for the force said.Oasis said in a statement they were \"shocked and saddened\" to hear of the death of a fan.\n",
      "They added: \"Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.\"The man reportedly fell from an upper tier.Police said the stadium was busy and they \"believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage\".The Met has asked anyone who may have information to get in touch via 101.It added that the investigation would be passed to the Health and Safety Executive in the next few days.\n",

      "📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\n",
      "How do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\n",
      "The storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \"unusually strong\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\n",
      "The area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\n",
      "Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\"She added: \"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\"\n",
      "Named storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\n",
      "The storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglyv396ppo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 A massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi has been blamed by Moscow on an overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Krasnodar region Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said drone debris hit a fuel tank and 127 firefighters were on Sunday tackling the blaze, which was later put out.The airport near Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games - briefly suspended flights.Meanwhile, Russia again bombed a key bridge in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, killing one man, local officials said. In nearby Mykolaiv, seven people were injured and several homes destroyed.Ukraine earlier reported seven deaths in Saturday's Russian attacks in the Kherson and eastern Donetsk regions.\n",
      "Russian authorities said the drone attack on the Sochi refinery was one of several launched by Ukraine over the weekend.They said installations were targeted in the central Russian cities of Ryazan, Penza, as well as Voronezh - not far from the border with Ukraine. The Voronezh regional governor said four people were injured in one drone strike.Ukraine has not commented on the strikes. It has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation to Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid throughout the war.Russia's defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, 60 of which were over the Black Sea region.Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 83 drones or 76 drones and seven missiles overnight, 61 of which were shot down. It added that 16 drones and six missiles struck targets in eight locations.\n",
      "In the city of Kherson, regional head Oleksandr Prokudin called for a partial evacuation after the key Ostrivsky bridge was again hit on Sunday morning.The bridge linking the Korabel island district with the rest of the city had already been badly damaged in Russian strikes earlier this week. Some 1,800 people still live in the district.The new Russian strikes come after a particularly deadly week for civilians in Ukraine, including anattack on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 31 people.More than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Ukrainian officials said, making the attack one of the deadliest on the capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger international sanctions on Russia this week, while US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports.On Monday, Trump set a new \"10 or 12\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn5e70v7lqqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Fifth Rothesay Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five)India 224(Nair 57, Atkinson 5-33, Tongue 3-57) &396(Jaiswal 118; Tongue 5-125)England 247(Crawley 64; Krishna 4-62, Siraj 4-86) &339-6(Brook 111, Root 105)England need 35 runs to win; India need four wicketsScorecard\n",
      "England need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light.In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play.Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale.Brook, on 111, lost his bat in miscuing Akash Deep to mid-off, Jacob Bethell was bowled attempting a wild hack and a poking Root was caught behind for 105.Jamie Overton joined Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith on their home ground with 37 required. Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.Both Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.Overton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2. The outcome is on a knife-edge.\n",
      "After seven weeks of drama, needle and outstanding cricket, perhaps it is only fitting that this memorable series will decided on the last possible day.Both sides might feel that this Test should already be won. That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.England fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.That India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.If anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away.There is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\n",
      "From 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.But Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.Brook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.Brook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.A dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.Bethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.Nerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\n",
      "Perhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.India left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.For so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.Smith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.The review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.The crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\n",
      "England batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:\"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same. We are in for a cracker for tomorrow. It will be a great finish.\"On his headband tribute to Graham Thorpe:\"I wish I had it in my pocket from the start. I put it there at tea. He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room. It is great to see everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people.\"...\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrx6dnkkeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Gonorrhoea vaccines will be widely available from today in sexual health clinics across the UK, in a bid to tackle record-breaking levels of infections.The jabs will first be offered to those at highest risk - mostly gay and bisexual men who have a history of multiple sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections.NHS England say the roll out is a world-first, and predict it could prevent as many as 100,000 cases, potentially saving the NHS almost £8m over the next decade.The Terrence Higgins Trust, whocampaigned for the vaccineto be introduced in the UK, told the BBC it was \"a huge win\" for sexual health.\n",
      "Gonorrhoea is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through unprotected sex.Symptoms can include pain, unusual discharge, inflammation of the genitals and infertility, but in some cases it can have no symptoms at all.The NHS saysit can be avoidedby the proper use of condoms and by accepting the vaccine if offered.Doctorsare becoming increasingly worriedabout the number of infections, and hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will also help slow thegrowing number of antibiotic-resistant cases.The vaccine, known as the 4CMenB vaccine, was designed for preventing meningitis B in babies, but the bacteria that causes the two diseases are so closely related that the jab is also effective against gonorrhoea.There were more than 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea in 2023 - the highest since records began almost 100 years ago.One of those diagnosed was Joey Knock, who says the infection gave him diarrhoea, made him feel \"wiped out\" and led to him taking time off work to recover.He told BBC News: \"I discussed it with my friends and I definitely had worse symptoms [than them] with it.\"I felt really bad, I couldn't keep food down and I just felt totally run down.\"\n",
      "Because he has many sexual partners, the 35-year-old decided to pay a private pharmacy for a course of gonorrhoea vaccinations in February 2024 before travelling abroad to a festival.He paid £220 and says he's glad he did it.\"It helps knowing that I'm taking control of my sexual health and doing what I can to stay safe and practise safer sex and be much less worried about the severity of the symptoms,\" he says.Joey says he uses the protection the vaccine offers him alongside other methods of safer sex, including taking PrEP, a drug which helps prevent HIV, and DoxyPep - antibiotics taken after sex to prevent bacterial STIs, a treatment not widely available on the NHS.He says he also occasionally uses condoms - but sees the vaccine as an extra tool to keep him safe in situations where he or his partner doesn't want to use them.Since being vaccinated, Joey has been re-infected with gonorrhoea but says the symptoms were much less severe.He told the BBC: \"I've been able to get on with my day and it has just become something much more manageable, and getting tested regularly and knowing my body really helps too.\"\n",
      "Matthew, a 63-year-old from East Scotland, was diagnosed with gonorrhoea 10 years ago and had a reaction known asreactive arthritis- extreme pain in your joints caused by your body's reaction to an infection.He told the BBC that the experience, which has caused lasting damage to some of his fingers and toes, was so painful it's left him fearful of becoming re-infected and has impacted his mental health.He says: \"I'm constantly looking for symptoms and I'm constantly aware of it, and I feel a bit like I used to do in the 1980s when I was constantly fretting about HIV.\"I'd get some sort of cough and think 'oh my god, what's happening?'\"He is hoping to be one of the first people to get a vaccine in order to give himself and his sexual partners more protection.\"You're not just protecting yourself, you're protecting your partners.\"I think it will also relieve some of the burden on sexual health services, it's getting difficult to get appointments so if it can work to reduce the incidence of STIs I think it's really worth it.\"Richard Angell, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading sexual health charity, told the BBC the vaccine was a \"remarkable addition to our toolkit on sexual health\".Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS national director for primary care and community services, said it was important \"everyone eligible takes up the offer through sexual health services\" in order to \"keep each other safe\".\"It's a real step forward for sexual health,\" she added.People who may be eligible for the vaccine are being asked to contacttheir local sexual health clinicfor more information....\n",

      "📄 Plans to evacuate more seriously ill or injured children from Gaza and bring them to the UK for medical treatment are being carried out \"at pace\", the government says.The BBC understands the aim is to bring the plan into operation within weeks.It is unclear how many children might be involved, butthe Sunday Times reportsthe government is to allow up to 300 young people to enter the UK to receive free medical care.Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.\n",
      "A government spokesperson said on Sunday the plan was to \"evacuate children from Gaza who require urgent medical care,\" adding \"we are working at pace to do so as quickly as possible.\"More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the war in Gaza begun in October 2023,according to the UN charity Unicef.A Foreign Affairs Committee report published at the end of July said the government had \"declined to support a medical evacuation of critically injured children to the UK, involving coordinating travel permits, medical visas and safe transport to the UK, where the children can receive specialised care unavailable to them in Gaza\".Following that, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \"urgently accelerating efforts\" to evacuate children who needed critical medical assistance to the UK for treatment.According to the Sunday Times, the government scheme will require a parent or guardian to accompany each child, and the Home Office will carry out biometric and security checks before they travel.\n",
      "Gazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuriesGazan girls arrive in UK for medical treatment\n",
      "Project Pure Hope, a British organisation which includes volunteer medical professionals, has so far brought three children to the UK for treatment.The most recent, 15-year-old Majd al-Shagnobi, arrived in the UK last week. He required complex facial reconstructive surgery after an Israeli tank shell destroyed his jaw when he was trying to access aid in February 2024. He was the first Palestinian child to be flown to the UK for treatment for war injuries.His evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.His treatment, privately funded by Project Pure Hope, will begin at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the coming days, carried out by a medical team who will all work for free.The organisation has been urging the government to establish a scheme similar to one created to treat Ukrainian refugees and welcomed the government's plan, saying it would be able to share its expertise from successful private evacuations.It said: \"Our blueprint can help ensure the UK acts quickly and effectively, so that every child who needs urgent care has the best chance of survival and recovery.\"\n",
      "In April, the group secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - to have privately funded operations in the UK for life-long medical conditions.They were brought to London after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza.Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing.

      "Medics have been warning of shortages in vital food and medical supplies for weeks, after Israel began a months-long blockade of all aid and goods into Gaza.This has since been partially lifted, but humanitarian agencies have said more aid must be allowed to enter to Gaza to prevent famine and malnutrition worsening.The Hamas-run health ministry said 175 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition.Israel denies it is deliberately blocking aid flowing into Gaza and accuses the UN and other aid agencies of failing to deliver it.Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region, and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory.Sir Keir said last week that theUK would recognise a Palestinian state in Septemberunless Israel took \"substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza\" - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism\".\n",

      "📄 Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and prayed there, violating a decades-old arrangement covering one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East.Photos and videos of his visit show Ben-Gvir leading Jewish prayers at the compound, which is known by Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem.Praying at the site breaks a long-time arrangement that allows Jews to visit the site but not pray.The Israeli prime minister's office released a statement saying there had been no change to Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.\n",
      "Jordan, custodian of the site, called Ben-Gvir's latest visit \"an unacceptable provocation\".Hamas called it \"a deepening of the ongoing aggressions against our Palestinian people\", while a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the visit \"crossed all red lines\".The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which runs the site, said Ben-Gvir was among 1,250 Jews who ascended the compound on Sunday morning.Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist who as national security minister oversees the police, hasvisited the site before, but the Times of Israel reported this was the first time that he openly prayed at the site.He was flanked by police officers while entering and touring the compound.In a statement at the site, Ben-Gvir said \"horror\" video of hostages recently released by Hamas, in which they appear emaciated, were aimed at putting pressure on Israel, and called for the hostages' return.The minister also repeated his call for Israel to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip and to encourage what he described as \"voluntary emigration\" of Palestinians from the territory.Experts say this would amount to the forced displacement of civilians, and a possible war crime.He hasbeen sanctioned by the UKfor \"repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities\" in the occupied West Bank....\"\n",

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\\n\\n📰 **Ukraine drone attack causes fire at Sochi oil depot, Russia says**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglyv396ppo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 A massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi has been blamed by Moscow on an overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Krasnodar region Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said drone debris hit a fuel tank and 127 firefighters were on Sunday tackling the blaze, which was later put out.The airport near Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games - briefly suspended flights.Meanwhile, Russia again bombed a key bridge in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, killing one man, local officials said. In nearby Mykolaiv, seven people were injured and several homes destroyed.Ukraine earlier reported seven deaths in Saturday's Russian attacks in the Kherson and eastern Donetsk regions.\\nRussian authorities said the drone attack on the Sochi refinery was one of several launched by Ukraine over the weekend.They said installations were targeted in the central Russian cities of Ryazan, Penza, as well as Voronezh - not far from the border with Ukraine. The Voronezh regional governor said four people were injured in one drone strike.Ukraine has not commented on the strikes. It has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation to Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid throughout the war.Russia's defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, 60 of which were over the Black Sea region.Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 83 drones or 76 drones and seven missiles overnight, 61 of which were shot down. It added that 16 drones and six missiles struck targets in eight locations.\\nIn the city of Kherson, regional head Oleksandr Prokudin called for a partial evacuation after the key Ostrivsky bridge was again hit on Sunday morning.The bridge linking the Korabel island district with the rest of the city had already been badly damaged in Russian strikes earlier this week. Some 1,800 people still live in the district.The new Russian strikes come after a particularly deadly week for civilians in Ukraine, including anattack on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 31 people.More than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Ukrainian officials said, making the attack one of the deadliest on the capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger international sanctions on Russia this week, while US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports.On Monday, Trump set a new \\\"10 or 12\\\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August....\\n\\n📰 **England need 35 to win astonishing final Test**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn5e70v7lqqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Fifth Rothesay Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five)India 224(Nair 57, Atkinson 5-33, Tongue 3-57) &396(Jaiswal 118; Tongue 5-125)England 247(Crawley 64; Krishna 4-62, Siraj 4-86) &339-6(Brook 111, Root 105)England need 35 runs to win; India need four wicketsScorecard\\nEngland need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light.In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play.Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale.Brook, on 111, lost his bat in miscuing Akash Deep to mid-off, Jacob Bethell was bowled attempting a wild hack and a poking Root was caught behind for 105.Jamie Overton joined Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith on their home ground with 37 required. Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.Both Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.Overton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2. The outcome is on a knife-edge.\\nAfter seven weeks of drama, needle and outstanding cricket, perhaps it is only fitting that this memorable series will decided on the last possible day.Both sides might feel that this Test should already be won. That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.England fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.That India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.If anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away.There is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\\nFrom 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.But Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.Brook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.Brook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.A dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.Bethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.Nerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\\nPerhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.India left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.For so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.Smith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.The review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.The crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\\nEngland batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:\\\"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same. We are in for a cracker for tomorrow. It will be a great finish.\\\"On his headband tribute to Graham Thorpe:\\\"I wish I had it in my pocket from the start. I put it there at tea. He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\\\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room. It is great to see everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people.\\\"...\\n\\n📰 **'I'm in control of my sexual health' - UK gonorrhoea vaccine rollout begins**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrx6dnkkeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Gonorrhoea vaccines will be widely available from today in sexual health clinics across the UK, in a bid to tackle record-breaking levels of infections.The jabs will first be offered to those at highest risk - mostly gay and bisexual men who have a history of multiple sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections.NHS England say the roll out is a world-first, and predict it could prevent as many as 100,000 cases, potentially saving the NHS almost £8m over the next decade.The Terrence Higgins Trust, whocampaigned for the vaccineto be introduced in the UK, told the BBC it was \\\"a huge win\\\" for sexual health.\\nGonorrhoea is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through unprotected sex.Symptoms can include pain, unusual discharge, inflammation of the genitals and infertility, but in some cases it can have no symptoms at all.The NHS saysit can be avoidedby the proper use of condoms and by accepting the vaccine if offered.Doctorsare becoming increasingly worriedabout the number of infections, and hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will also help slow thegrowing number of antibiotic-resistant cases.The vaccine, known as the 4CMenB vaccine, was designed for preventing meningitis B in babies, but the bacteria that causes the two diseases are so closely related that the jab is also effective against gonorrhoea.There were more than 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea in 2023 - the highest since records began almost 100 years ago.One of those diagnosed was Joey Knock, who says the infection gave him diarrhoea, made him feel \\\"wiped out\\\" and led to him taking time off work to recover.He told BBC News: \\\"I discussed it with my friends and I definitely had worse symptoms [than them] with it.\\\"I felt really bad, I couldn't keep food down and I just felt totally run down.\\\"\\nBecause he has many sexual partners, the 35-year-old decided to pay a private pharmacy for a course of gonorrhoea vaccinations in February 2024 before travelling abroad to a festival.He paid £220 and says he's glad he did it.\\\"It helps knowing that I'm taking control of my sexual health and doing what I can to stay safe and practise safer sex and be much less worried about the severity of the symptoms,\\\" he says.Joey says he uses the protection the vaccine offers him alongside other methods of safer sex, including taking PrEP, a drug which helps prevent HIV, and DoxyPep - antibiotics taken after sex to prevent bacterial STIs, a treatment not widely available on the NHS.He says he also occasionally uses condoms - but sees the vaccine as an extra tool to keep him safe in situations where he or his partner doesn't want to use them.Since being vaccinated, Joey has been re-infected with gonorrhoea but says the symptoms were much less severe.He told the BBC: \\\"I've been able to get on with my day and it has just become something much more manageable, and getting tested regularly and knowing my body really helps too.\\\"\\nMatthew, a 63-year-old from East Scotland, was diagnosed with gonorrhoea 10 years ago and had a reaction known asreactive arthritis- extreme pain in your joints caused by your body's reaction to an infection.He told the BBC that the experience, which has caused lasting damage to some of his fingers and toes, was so painful it's left him fearful of becoming re-infected and has impacted his mental health.He says: \\\"I'm constantly looking for symptoms and I'm constantly aware of it, and I feel a bit like I used to do in the 1980s when I was constantly fretting about HIV.\\\"I'd get some sort of cough and think 'oh my god, what's happening?'\\\"He is hoping to be one of the first people to get a vaccine in order to give himself and his sexual partners more protection.\\\"You're not just protecting yourself, you're protecting your partners.\\\"I think it will also relieve some of the burden on sexual health services, it's getting difficult to get appointments so if it can work to reduce the incidence of STIs I think it's really worth it.\\\"Richard Angell, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading sexual health charity, told the BBC the vaccine was a \\\"remarkable addition to our toolkit on sexual health\\\".Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS national director for primary care and community services, said it was important \\\"everyone eligible takes up the offer through sexual health services\\\" in order to \\\"keep each other safe\\\".\\\"It's a real step forward for sexual health,\\\" she added.People who may be eligible for the vaccine are being asked to contacttheir local sexual health clinicfor more information....\\n\\n📰 **Government plans to bring more Gazan children to UK for treatment**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e641p41po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Plans to evacuate more seriously ill or injured children from Gaza and bring them to the UK for medical treatment are being carried out \\\"at pace\\\", the government says.The BBC understands the aim is to bring the plan into operation within weeks.It is unclear how many children might be involved, butthe Sunday Times reportsthe government is to allow up to 300 young people to enter the UK to receive free medical care.Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.\\nA government spokesperson said on Sunday the plan was to \\\"evacuate children from Gaza who require urgent medical care,\\\" adding \\\"we are working at pace to do so as quickly as possible.\\\"More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the war in Gaza begun in October 2023,according to the UN charity Unicef.A Foreign Affairs Committee report published at the end of July said the government had \\\"declined to support a medical evacuation of critically injured children to the UK, involving coordinating travel permits, medical visas and safe transport to the UK, where the children can receive specialised care unavailable to them in Gaza\\\".Following that, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \\\"urgently accelerating efforts\\\" to evacuate children who needed critical medical assistance to the UK for treatment.According to the Sunday Times, the government scheme will require a parent or guardian to accompany each child, and the Home Office will carry out biometric and security checks before they travel.\\nGazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuriesGazan girls arrive in UK for medical treatment\\nProject Pure Hope, a British organisation which includes volunteer medical professionals, has so far brought three children to the UK for treatment.The most recent, 15-year-old Majd al-Shagnobi, arrived in the UK last week. He required complex facial reconstructive surgery after an Israeli tank shell destroyed his jaw when he was trying to access aid in February 2024. He was the first Palestinian child to be flown to the UK for treatment for war injuries.His evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.His treatment, privately funded by Project Pure Hope, will begin at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the coming days, carried out by a medical team who will all work for free.The organisation has been urging the government to establish a scheme similar to one created to treat Ukrainian refugees and welcomed the government's plan, saying it would be able to share its expertise from successful private evacuations.It said: \\\"Our blueprint can help ensure the UK acts quickly and effectively, so that every child who needs urgent care has the best chance of survival and recovery.\\\"\\nIn April, the group secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - to have privately funded operations in the UK for life-long medical conditions.They were brought to London after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza.Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing. And Rama has had exploratory surgery for a serious bowel condition.Their mothers say both girls are doing well.\\nMedics have been warning of shortages in vital food and medical supplies for weeks, after Israel began a months-long blockade of all aid and goods into Gaza.This has since been partially lifted, but humanitarian agencies have said more aid must be allowed to enter to Gaza to prevent famine and malnutrition worsening.The Hamas-run health ministry said 175 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition.Israel denies it is deliberately blocking aid flowing into Gaza and accuses the UN and other aid agencies of failing to deliver it.Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region, and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory.Sir Keir said last week that theUK would recognise a Palestinian state in Septemberunless Israel took \\\"substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza\\\" - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \\\"rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism\\\".\\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 60,000 people have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry....\\n\\n📰 **Israeli minister sparks anger by praying at sensitive Jerusalem holy site**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjxg65p56o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and prayed there, violating a decades-old arrangement covering one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East.Photos and videos of his visit show Ben-Gvir leading Jewish prayers at the compound, which is known by Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem.Praying at the site breaks a long-time arrangement that allows Jews to visit the site but not pray.The Israeli prime minister's office released a statement saying there had been no change to Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.\\nJordan, custodian of the site, called Ben-Gvir's latest visit \\\"an unacceptable provocation\\\".Hamas called it \\\"a deepening of the ongoing aggressions against our Palestinian people\\\", while a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the visit \\\"crossed all red lines\\\".The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which runs the site, said Ben-Gvir was among 1,250 Jews who ascended the compound on Sunday morning.Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist who as national security minister oversees the police, hasvisited the site before, but the Times of Israel reported this was the first time that he openly prayed at the site.He was flanked by police officers while entering and touring the compound.In a statement at the site, Ben-Gvir said \\\"horror\\\" video of hostages recently released by Hamas, in which they appear emaciated, were aimed at putting pressure on Israel, and called for the hostages' return.The minister also repeated his call for Israel to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip and to encourage what he described as \\\"voluntary emigration\\\" of Palestinians from the territory.Experts say this would amount to the forced displacement of civilians, and a possible war crime.He hasbeen sanctioned by the UKfor \\\"repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities\\\" in the occupied West Bank....\\nAI: Here are 10 recent news headlines and summaries based on your request:\\n\\n1. **Victims of mis-sold car finance may get <£950 per deal**  \\n   *Compensation scheme proposed by UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) after Supreme Court ruling rejected claims of unlawful hidden commissions.

It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\\\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \\\"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\\\"\\nThe issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \\\"if they were not properly disclosed\\\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \\\"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\\\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \\\"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\\\"....\\n\\n📰 **Leaders condemn videos of emaciated hostages as Red Cross calls for access**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \\\"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\\\" and they must be released \\\"unconditionally\\\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\\nBoth Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \\\"profound shock\\\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \\\"will continue constantly and relentlessly\\\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \\\"appalled\\\" by the videos that gave \\\"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\\\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \\\"everyone must get out of hell, now.\\\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \\\"crumbs of falafels\\\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \\\"is at death's door\\\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \\\"they managed to break Rom\\\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\\\"He has simply been forgotten there,\\\" they said.\\nIn the second video, David said \\\"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\\\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \\\"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\\\".\\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \\\"appalled\\\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \\\"abject cruelty\\\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \\\"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\\\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \\\"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\\\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\\n\\n📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 The sheet of paper says \\\"Wanted Person\\\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \\\"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\\\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \\\"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\\\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\\nThe new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\\\"I've never been this close,\\\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \\\"authoritarian regime\\\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\\nChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\\\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\\\" says Carmen.\\nIn 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\\n\\\"You know the tactics of the regime,\\\" she says. \\\"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\\\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \\\"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\\\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\\\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\\\" she says.\\nSteve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \\\"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\\\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \\\"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\\\".\\nThere is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\\nThis has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\\\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\\\" he says.\\nHowever, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \\\"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\\\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\\\"\\nAt the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \\\"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\\\" he says.\\\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\\\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\\nBut Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\\\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\\\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \\\"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\\\".\\nChina's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\\nSince then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \\\"golden era\\\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\\\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\\\" he argues.\\\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\\\"\\nLord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \\\"continued tension\\\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\\n\\\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\\\" says Lord Ricketts. \\\"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\\\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\\\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \\\"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\\\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\\\"\\nThe Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \\\"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\\\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\\\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\\\" he argues, \\\"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\\\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\\\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\\\" he says.But, equally, \\\"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\\\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\\nTop image credits: Reuters, Richard Baker via Getty Images, SOPA Images via Getty Images and EPA -EFE/REX/Shutterstock\\nBBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Our thoughts go out to his family, who have been informed and are being supported by specially trained police officers,\\\" it said.The Oasis concert on Sunday went ahead as planned.The band will next appear in Edinburgh for three gigs on 8, 9 and 12 August and then take their tour to Ireland, Canada, the US and Mexico before returning to Wembley on 27 and 28 September....\\n\\n📰 **Amber warning issued ahead of Storm Floris**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\\nHow do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\\nThe storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \\\"unusually strong\\\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\\nThe area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\\nScottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\\\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\\\"She added: \\\"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\\\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \\\"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\\\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \\\"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\\\"\\nNamed storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \\\"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\\\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\\nThe storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\\n\\n📰 **Ukraine drone attack causes fire at Sochi oil depot, Russia says**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglyv396ppo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 A massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi has been blamed by Moscow on an overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Krasnodar region Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said drone debris hit a fuel tank and 127 firefighters were on Sunday tackling the blaze, which was later put out.The airport near Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games - briefly suspended flights.Meanwhile, Russia again bombed a key bridge in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, killing one man, local officials said. In nearby Mykolaiv, seven people were injured and several homes destroyed.Ukraine earlier reported seven deaths in Saturday's Russian attacks in the Kherson and eastern Donetsk regions.\\nRussian authorities said the drone attack on the Sochi refinery was one of several launched by Ukraine over the weekend.They said installations were targeted in the central Russian cities of Ryazan, Penza, as well as Voronezh - not far from the border with Ukraine. The Voronezh regional governor said four people were injured in one drone strike.Ukraine has not commented on the strikes. It has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation to Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid throughout the war.Russia's defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, 60 of which were over the Black Sea region.Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 83 drones or 76 drones and seven missiles overnight, 61 of which were shot down. It added that 16 drones and six missiles struck targets in eight locations.\\nIn the city of Kherson, regional head Oleksandr Prokudin called for a partial evacuation after the key Ostrivsky bridge was again hit on Sunday morning.The bridge linking the Korabel island district with the rest of the city had already been badly damaged in Russian strikes earlier this week. Some 1,800 people still live in the district.The new Russian strikes come after a particularly deadly week for civilians in Ukraine, including anattack on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 31 people.More than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Ukrainian officials said, making the attack one of the deadliest on the capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger international sanctions on Russia this week, while US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports.On Monday, Trump set a new \\\"10 or 12\\\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August....\\n\\n📰 **England need 35 to win astonishing final Test**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn5e70v7lqqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Fifth Rothesay Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five)India 224(Nair 57, Atkinson 5-33, Tongue 3-57) &396(Jaiswal 118; Tongue 5-125)England 247(Crawley 64; Krishna 4-62, Siraj 4-86) &339-6(Brook 111, Root 105)England need 35 runs to win; India need four wicketsScorecard\\nEngland need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light.In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play.Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale.Brook, on 111, lost his bat in miscuing Akash Deep to mid-off, Jacob Bethell was bowled attempting a wild hack and a poking Root was caught behind for 105.Jamie Overton joined Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith on their home ground with 37 required. Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.Both Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.Overton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2. The outcome is on a knife-edge.\\nAfter seven weeks of drama, needle and outstanding cricket, perhaps it is only fitting that this memorable series will decided on the last possible day.Both sides might feel that this Test should already be won. That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.England fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.That India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.If anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away.There is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\\nFrom 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.But Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.Brook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.Brook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.A dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.Bethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.Nerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\\nPerhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.India left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.For so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.Smith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.The review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.The crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\\nEngland batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:\\\"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same. We are in for a cracker for tomorrow. It will be a great finish.\\\"On his headband tribute to Graham Thorpe:\\\"I wish I had it in my pocket from the start. I put it there at tea. He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\\\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room. It is great to see everyone show the amount of love for him throughout this week because he is a real legend of English cricket and has done so much good for so many people.\\\"...\\n\\n📰 **'I'm in control of my sexual health' - UK gonorrhoea vaccine rollout begins**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkrx6dnkkeo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Gonorrhoea vaccines will be widely available from today in sexual health clinics across the UK, in a bid to tackle record-breaking levels of infections.The jabs will first be offered to those at highest risk - mostly gay and bisexual men who have a history of multiple sexual partners or sexually transmitted infections.NHS England say the roll out is a world-first, and predict it could prevent as many as 100,000 cases, potentially saving the NHS almost £8m over the next decade.The Terrence Higgins Trust, whocampaigned for the vaccineto be introduced in the UK, told the BBC it was \\\"a huge win\\\" for sexual health.\\nGonorrhoea is a bacterial infection that is transmitted through unprotected sex.Symptoms can include pain, unusual discharge, inflammation of the genitals and infertility, but in some cases it can have no symptoms at all.The NHS saysit can be avoidedby the proper use of condoms and by accepting the vaccine if offered.Doctorsare becoming increasingly worriedabout the number of infections, and hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will also help slow thegrowing number of antibiotic-resistant cases.The vaccine, known as the 4CMenB vaccine, was designed for preventing meningitis B in babies, but the bacteria that causes the two diseases are so closely related that the jab is also effective against gonorrhoea.There were more than 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea in 2023 - the highest since records began almost 100 years ago.One of those diagnosed was Joey Knock, who says the infection gave him diarrhoea, made him feel \\\"wiped out\\\" and led to him taking time off work to recover.He told BBC News: \\\"I discussed it with my friends and I definitely had worse symptoms [than them] with it.\\\"I felt really bad, I couldn't keep food down and I just felt totally run down.\\\"\\nBecause he has many sexual partners, the 35-year-old decided to pay a private pharmacy for a course of gonorrhoea vaccinations in February 2024 before travelling abroad to a festival.He paid £220 and says he's glad he did it.\\\"It helps knowing that I'm taking control of my sexual health and doing what I can to stay safe and practise safer sex and be much less worried about the severity of the symptoms,\\\" he says.Joey says he uses the protection the vaccine offers him alongside other methods of safer sex, including taking PrEP, a drug which helps prevent HIV, and DoxyPep - antibiotics taken after sex to prevent bacterial STIs, a treatment not widely available on the NHS.He says he also occasionally uses condoms - but sees the vaccine as an extra tool to keep him safe in situations where he or his partner doesn't want to use them.Since being vaccinated, Joey has been re-infected with gonorrhoea but says the symptoms were much less severe.He told the BBC: \\\"I've been able to get on with my day and it has just become something much more manageable, and getting tested regularly and knowing my body really helps too.\\\"\\nMatthew, a 63-year-old from East Scotland, was diagnosed with gonorrhoea 10 years ago and had a reaction known asreactive arthritis- extreme pain in your joints caused by your body's reaction to an infection.He told the BBC that the experience, which has caused lasting damage to some of his fingers and toes, was so painful it's left him fearful of becoming re-infected and has impacted his mental health.He says: \\\"I'm constantly looking for symptoms and I'm constantly aware of it, and I feel a bit like I used to do in the 1980s when I was constantly fretting about HIV.\\\"I'd get some sort of cough and think 'oh my god, what's happening?'\\\"He is hoping to be one of the first people to get a vaccine in order to give himself and his sexual partners more protection.\\\"You're not just protecting yourself, you're protecting your partners.\\\"I think it will also relieve some of the burden on sexual health services, it's getting difficult to get appointments so if it can work to reduce the incidence of STIs I think it's really worth it.\\\"Richard Angell, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading sexual health charity, told the BBC the vaccine was a \\\"remarkable addition to our toolkit on sexual health\\\".Dr Amanda Doyle, NHS national director for primary care and community services, said it was important \\\"everyone eligible takes up the offer through sexual health services\\\" in order to \\\"keep each other safe\\\".\\\"It's a real step forward for sexual health,\\\" she added.People who may be eligible for the vaccine are being asked to contacttheir local sexual health clinicfor more information....\\n\\n📰 **Government plans to bring more Gazan children to UK for treatment**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e641p41po?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Plans to evacuate more seriously ill or injured children from Gaza and bring them to the UK for medical treatment are being carried out \\\"at pace\\\", the government says.The BBC understands the aim is to bring the plan into operation within weeks.It is unclear how many children might be involved, butthe Sunday Times reportsthe government is to allow up to 300 young people to enter the UK to receive free medical care.Some Gazan children have already been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government has so far not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.\\nA government spokesperson said on Sunday the plan was to \\\"evacuate children from Gaza who require urgent medical care,\\\" adding \\\"we are working at pace to do so as quickly as possible.\\\"More than 50,000 children have been killed or injured since the war in Gaza begun in October 2023,according to the UN charity Unicef.A Foreign Affairs Committee report published at the end of July said the government had \\\"declined to support a medical evacuation of critically injured children to the UK, involving coordinating travel permits, medical visas and safe transport to the UK, where the children can receive specialised care unavailable to them in Gaza\\\".Following that, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was \\\"urgently accelerating efforts\\\" to evacuate children who needed critical medical assistance to the UK for treatment.According to the Sunday Times, the government scheme will require a parent or guardian to accompany each child, and the Home Office will carry out biometric and security checks before they travel.\\nGazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuriesGazan girls arrive in UK for medical treatment\\nProject Pure Hope, a British organisation which includes volunteer medical professionals, has so far brought three children to the UK for treatment.The most recent, 15-year-old Majd al-Shagnobi, arrived in the UK last week. He required complex facial reconstructive surgery after an Israeli tank shell destroyed his jaw when he was trying to access aid in February 2024. He was the first Palestinian child to be flown to the UK for treatment for war injuries.His evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.His treatment, privately funded by Project Pure Hope, will begin at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in the coming days, carried out by a medical team who will all work for free.The organisation has been urging the government to establish a scheme similar to one created to treat Ukrainian refugees and welcomed the government's plan, saying it would be able to share its expertise from successful private evacuations.It said: \\\"Our blueprint can help ensure the UK acts quickly and effectively, so that every child who needs urgent care has the best chance of survival and recovery.\\\"\\nIn April, the group secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - to have privately funded operations in the UK for life-long medical conditions.They were brought to London after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza.Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing. And Rama has had exploratory surgery for a serious bowel condition.Their mothers say both girls are doing well.\\nMedics have been warning of shortages in vital food and medical supplies for weeks, after Israel began a months-long blockade of all aid and goods into Gaza.This has since been partially lifted, but humanitarian agencies have said more aid must be allowed to enter to Gaza to prevent famine and malnutrition worsening.The Hamas-run health ministry said 175 people, including 93 children, have died from malnutrition.Israel denies it is deliberately blocking aid flowing into Gaza and accuses the UN and other aid agencies of failing to deliver it.Since the start of the war, the UK has provided funds so that injured Gazans can be treated by hospitals in the region, and has also been working with Jordan to airdrop aid into the territory.Sir Keir said last week that theUK would recognise a Palestinian state in Septemberunless Israel took \\\"substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza\\\" - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \\\"rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism\\\".\\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 60,000 people have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry....\\n\\n📰 **Israeli minister sparks anger by praying at sensitive Jerusalem holy site**\\n🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjxg65p56o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\\n📄 Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has visited the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem and prayed there, violating a decades-old arrangement covering one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East.Photos and videos of his visit show Ben-Gvir leading Jewish prayers at the compound, which is known by Jews as the Temple Mount, in occupied East Jerusalem.Praying at the site breaks a long-time arrangement that allows Jews to visit the site but not pray.The Israeli prime minister's office released a statement saying there had been no change to Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo agreement that allows only Muslim worship there.\\nJordan, custodian of the site, called Ben-Gvir's latest visit \\\"an unacceptable provocation\\\".Hamas called it \\\"a deepening of the ongoing aggressions against our Palestinian people\\\", while a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the visit \\\"crossed all red lines\\\".The site is the holiest place for Jews because it was the site of two Biblical temples. It is the third holiest place for Muslims, who believe it was where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Under the status quo, Jordan was allowed to continue its historical role as custodian of the site, while Israel assumed control of security and access.Palestinians accuse Israel of taking steps to undermine the arrangements and complain that in recent years Jewish visitors have often been seen praying without being stopped by Israeli police.The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which runs the site, said Ben-Gvir was among 1,250 Jews who ascended the compound on Sunday morning.Ben-Gvir, an ultra-nationalist who as national security minister oversees the police, hasvisited the site before, but the Times of Israel reported this was the first time that he openly prayed at the site.He was flanked by police officers while entering and touring the compound.In a statement at the site, Ben-Gvir said \\\"horror\\\" video of hostages recently released by Hamas, in which they appear emaciated, were aimed at putting pressure on Israel, and called for the hostages' return.The minister also repeated his call for Israel to occupy the whole of the Gaza Strip and to encourage what he described as \\\"voluntary emigration\\\" of Palestinians from the territory.Experts say this would amount to the forced displacement of civilians, and a possible war crime.He hasbeen sanctioned by the UKfor \\\"repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities\\\" in the occupied West Bank....\"\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjy29zql25o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Victims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.The Supreme Court ruled on Fridaythat hidden commissions from lenders to dealers on car loans were not unlawful, meaning millions of motorists will not be able to claim.However, the judgement left open the possibility of compensation claims for particularly large commissions which the Supreme Court said were unfair.Following the ruling, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme - estimated to cost between £9bn and £18bn.\n",
      "The FCA said it was \"hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme\", but it is understood that millions could be eligible.The industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs.Those who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company.It added that it \"anticipate[s] requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do\" and that claims \"should cover agreements dating back to 2007\".However, the Finance & Leasing Association has said it is concerned \"about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information\".The FCA said it will start its consultation on who should be eligible for compensation and how much they should get in October, adding that the Supreme Court ruling provided \"clarity\".On Friday, the Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful.The case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa's FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won a Court of Appeal case in October.However, the Supreme Court ruled that if commission is extremely high, such as in the case brought by Marcus Johnson, where the commission paid to the dealer was 55% of the total charge or credit including interest and fees - that this was a \"powerful indication\" the relationship between Mr Johnson and lender FirstRand was unfair.The Supreme Court awarded Mr Johnson the amount of a commission plus interest.The FCA said Friday's judgement \"helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts\".FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: \"It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It's fair for their customers to be compensated.\"He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: \"If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.\"\n",
      "The issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs \"if they were not properly disclosed\" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the \"degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles\".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects \"a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose\"....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2dwn7q40o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Western leaders have condemned videos of emaciated Israeli hostages filmed by their captors in Gaza, with the Red Cross calling for access to all remaining in captivity.UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said \"images of hostages being paraded for propaganda are sickening\" and they must be released \"unconditionally\".The calls come after the Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of Rom Braslavski, thin and crying, on Thursday, and Hamas released footage of an emaciated Evyatar David on Saturday.Israeli leaders accused Hamas of starving hostages.Hamas's armed wing denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people eat amid a hunger crisis in Gaza.\n",
      "Both Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were taken hostage from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel.They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".Braslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.\n",
      "In the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water\" and is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.His family said he was being \"deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza - a living skeleton, buried alive\".\n",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was \"appalled\" by the images, adding the release of all hostages was a mandatory prerequisite for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.French President Emmanuel Macron, who said Hamas embodies \"abject cruelty\", added France continues to work tirelessly towards the release of hostages, to restore a ceasefire, and to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.He said this effort must be accompanied with a political solution, with a two-state solution \"with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace\". France recently announced its intention to recognise a Palestinian state, along with Canada and the UK, under certain conditions. Israel has strongly condemned the moves.The images of emaciated hostages are coming out as UN-backed agencies have said the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\" in Gaza, with malnutrition deaths reported daily.The Hamas-run health ministry said on Sunday that 175 people, including 93 children, have died of malnutrition since the start of the war.The UN, aid agencies and some of Israel's allies blame the hunger crisis on Israeli restrictions on the entry and delivery of humanitarian aid. Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage.Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act....\n",

      "📰 **Hackers, secret cables and security fears: The explosive fight over the UK's new Chinese embassy**\n",
      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v3rygdrryo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 The sheet of paper says \"Wanted Person\" at the top. Below is a photo of a young woman, a headshot that might have been taken in a studio. She looks directly at the camera, smiling with her teeth showing, and her dark, shoulder-length hair is neatly brushed.At the bottom, in red, are the words: \"A reward of one million Hong Kong dollars,\" together with a UK phone number.To earn the money, about £95,000, there is a simple instruction: \"Provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take her to Chinese embassy\".The woman from the photo is standing in front of me. She shudders when she looks at the building.We are outside an imposing structure that was once home to the Royal Mint and which China hopes it can develop into a new mega-embassy in London, replacing the far smaller premises it has occupied since 1877.\n",
      "The new premises, opposite the Tower of London, is already being patrolled by Chinese security guards. The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?\n",
      "China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.\n",
      "In 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.\n",
      "\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you. My friends and my colleagues were being arrested.\"Carmen fled to London but believes that she has continued to be targeted.Hong Kong issued two arrest warrants for her alleging \"incitement to secession and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\".The bounty letter sent from Hong Kong to half a dozen of her neighbours followed.\"The regime just [tries] to eliminate any possible activists overseas,\" she says.\n",
      "Steve Tsang, a political scientist and historian who is director of the SOAS China Institute, says he can see why people from Hong Kong, or certain other backgrounds, may be uncomfortable with the new embassy.He argues \"the Chinese government since 1949 does not have a record of kidnapping people and holding them in their embassy compounds.\"But he says some embassy staff would be tasked with monitoring Chinese students and dissidents in the UK and they'd also target UK citizens, such as scientists, business people, and those with influence, to advance China's interests.The Chinese embassy told the BBC it \"is committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities\".\n",
      "There is another fear, held by some opponents, that the Royal Mint Court site could allow China to infiltrate the UK's financial system by tapping into fibre optic cables carrying sensitive data for firms in the City of London.The site once housed Barclays Bank's trading floor, so it was wired directly into the UK's financial infrastructure. Nearby, a tunnel has, since 1985, carried fibre optic cables under the Thames serving hundreds of City firms.And in the grounds of the Court, is a five-storey brick building - the Wapping Telephone Exchange that serves the City of London.According to Prof Periklis Petropoulos, an optoelectronics researcher at Southampton University, direct access to a working telephone exchange could allow people to glean information.\n",
      "This has all prompted warnings about potential espionage - including from Conservative frontbencher Kevin Hollinrake, as well as senior Republicans in the US.An official with security experience in former US president Joe Biden's administration told me it's perfectly possible that cables could be tapped with devices that would capture passing information - and that this would be almost impossible to detect.\"Anything up to half a mile from the embassy would be vulnerable,\" he says.\n",
      "However, he argues that China may not be inclined to do this because it has other ways of hacking into systems.Regarding these concerns, the Chinese embassy said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application.\"This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"\n",
      "At the back of the Royal Mint Court is a row of 1980s-built flats. Mark Nygate has lived here for more than 20 years. He gestures across his low garden wall. \"Embassy staff will live there and overlook us,\" he says.\"We don't want [the embassy] there because of demonstrations, because of the security risks, because of our privacy.\"Opponents of the embassy - Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uighurs, and opposition politicians - have already staged protests involving up to 6,000 people.Mostly, though, he fears an attack on the embassy - that could harm him and his neighbours.\n",
      "But Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE Department of Government, lives near the current embassy and isn't convinced that these sorts of protests will materialise for the new neighbours, if the relocation goes ahead.\"I'm not aware of any evidence that there are regular protests that block the road outside the current Chinese embassy… self-evidently, there are much larger protests outside a number of other countries' embassies and high commissions.\"The Chinese embassy in London says that the proposed development would \"greatly improve the surrounding environment and bring benefits to the local community and the district\".\n",
      "China's first planning application to develop the site was rejected by Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns - and fears protests and security measures could damage tourism.Rather than amend the plan or appeal, China waited, then resubmitted an identical application in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power.On 23 August, Sir Keir Starmer phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping for their first talks. Afterwards Sir Keir confirmed that Xi had raised the issue of the embassy.\n",
      "Since then, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has exercised her power to take the matter out of the council's hands, after being urged to do so by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.This is in the context of an attempt by the government to engage with China after previous Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared in 2022 that the so-called \"golden era\" of UK-China relations were over.For his part, Prof Travers believes that politics is involved in planning decisions.\"The Secretary of State has to make the decision on the basis of the documentation in front of them and the law surrounding and affecting the issue,\" he argues.\"But it would be naïve to imagine that politics didn't play a role.\"\n",
      "Lord Peter Ricketts, a former diplomat who chaired the UK's National Security Council, advising prime ministers on global threats, stresses that the country's relationship with China is complex.A National Security Strategy published in June laid out the conflicting priorities in the government's approach, highlighting its desire to use the relationship to boost the UK economy but also likely \"continued tension\" over human rights and cyber security.But is that duality of reaping the business benefits while pushing on the human rights transgressions, even possible?\n",
      "\"It is absolutely an adversary in some areas, which tries to steal our intellectual property, or suborn our citizens,\" says Lord Ricketts. \"(But) it is a commercial market, a very important one for us, and it's a player in the big global issues like climate and health.\"We have to be able to treat China in all those categories at the same time.\"The embassy decision, he says, cuts to the heart of this. \"There are acute dilemmas, and there are choices to be made, whether to privilege the 30, 40 or 50-year relationship with China, which an embassy, I guess, would symbolise.\"Or whether to give priority to the short-term security threats, which are no doubt real as well.\"\n",
      "The Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith is convinced giving the go-ahead for the new embassy would be a big mistake. \"They think that the only way they'll get growth is by kissing up to China and getting them to invest,\" he tells me.But for all the concerns around security, having one big embassy could well make it easier to keep an eye on what Chinese officials are up to in the UK, according to Prof Tsang.\"Allowing the Chinese to put their staff on one site is preferable,\" he argues, \"because they're at the moment all over the place in London, you can't actually keep an eye on them.\"He is not convinced that rejecting or approving the embassy will have an effect on business and trade.\"The Chinese are the absolute ultimate pragmatists. They are not going to suddenly say that no, we're not selling our best electric vehicles to you any longer just because you denied us the embassy,\" he says.But, equally, \"they are not going to substantially increase Chinese investments in the UK because they have got the new embassy compound.\"If Angela Rayner thinks that too, then her decision may well come down to how seriously she takes the warnings that China could eavesdrop on the UK's banks.If she rejects the embassy it may be because she judges the danger it poses to be very real indeed.\n",

      "📄 A man has died after falling from a height at an Oasis concert on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police has said.Police said officers and medics at Wembley Stadium in London responded to reports that a man in his 40s had been injured at 22:19 BST.The man \"was found with injuries consistent with a fall\" and was pronounced dead at the scene, a spokesperson for the force said.Oasis said in a statement they were \"shocked and saddened\" to hear of the death of a fan.\n",
      "They added: \"Oasis would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.\"The man reportedly fell from an upper tier.Police said the stadium was busy and they \"believe it is likely a number of people witnessed the incident, or may knowingly or unknowingly have caught it on mobile phone video footage\".The Met has asked anyone who may have information to get in touch via 101.It added that the investigation would be passed to the Health and Safety Executive in the next few days.\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3n049jno?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Weather warnings have beenupgraded to amberfor most of Scotland as Storm Floris bears down on the UK.The warning lasts from 10:00 BST on Monday through to 22:00 and warns of danger to life as damage to buildings and trees due to storm conditions is expected.There is also a yellow warning across northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland from 06:00 BST on Monday through to midnight.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season, and the first since January.\n",
      "How do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?\n",
      "The storm is yet to develop but there will be a rapid drop in pressure as the system nears British shores on Sunday night.It is expected to bring \"unusually strong\" west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland.The amber warning covers a wide area as far south as the country's central belt - including Glasgow and Edinburgh and also the Highlands.Gusts of 50 to 70mph are expected, even inland. Exposed coasts, hills and bridges could see gusts of 80 to 90mph, while some models have even suggested 100mph gusts which were last seen during Storm Éowyn in January.The worst of the winds will be in the western coastal areas of the warning zone between late morning and early afternoon.As the storm spirals away by late afternoon and early evening the strongest winds will move further eastwards to coastal areas of Aberdeenshire.Trees are in full leaf at this time of year and are more likely to be toppled with branches broken off than during winter when the wind can whistle through them unimpeded.Power disruption is also possible while heavy rain and flooding could be an additional hazard.\n",
      "The area affected by the yellow warning includes Yorkshire and Humber, north Wales, North West England, North East England, Northern Ireland and all of Scotland including Orkney and the Shetland Islands.Many inland areas are likely to see gusts of 40 to 50mph with 60 to 70mph possible along exposed coasts and high ground.\n",
      "Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said a meeting had been held on Friday to ensure Scotland was ready for the storm.\"Given the unusual timing, and the fact some people will be on holiday, travelling or perhaps unaware, we are trying to raise even more awareness than usual of this potentially disruptive storm.\"She added: \"This is a slightly unusual situation for August, however the message is the same as winter - plan ahead, check your journey in advance, allow extra time and don't take any unnecessary risks.\"National Rail has warned that speed restrictions are likely and warned journey delays and cancellations are possible.Strong winds can also bring down trees that block tracks and damage power lines.Operator LNER warned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. It said those intending to travel on Monday could do so on Sunday, and tickets would also be valid until Wednesday.Avanti West Coast advised passengers not to travel north of Preston on Monday, saying tickets will be accepted on Sunday and Tuesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac has issued a series of cancellation warnings ahead of the storm.In a post on X it said: \"Disruption to sailings is expected across our network on Monday, August 4 due to forecasted strong winds across parts of Scotland's west coast.\"Meanwhile, motorists are urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Rod Dennis, from breakdown service RAC, said: \"It's the height of the holiday season, so those towing trailers and caravans, as well as those with roof and tent boxes, must ensure their loads are properly secured.\"\n",
      "Named storms in August are not that rare.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.In 2023, Storm Antoni brought wet and very windy weather to south Wales and south-west England affecting events such as Brighton and Plymouth Pride. Less than two weeks later Storm Betty brought further disruption.In 2020 there were also two August storms - Ellen and Francis - that the Met Office describes as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\".These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.\n",
      "The storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglyv396ppo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 A massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi has been blamed by Moscow on an overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Krasnodar region Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said drone debris hit a fuel tank and 127 firefighters were on Sunday tackling the blaze, which was later put out.The airport near Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games - briefly suspended flights.Meanwhile, Russia again bombed a key bridge in Ukraine's southern city of Kherson, killing one man, local officials said. In nearby Mykolaiv, seven people were injured and several homes destroyed.Ukraine earlier reported seven deaths in Saturday's Russian attacks in the Kherson and eastern Donetsk regions.\n",
      "Russian authorities said the drone attack on the Sochi refinery was one of several launched by Ukraine over the weekend.They said installations were targeted in the central Russian cities of Ryazan, Penza, as well as Voronezh - not far from the border with Ukraine. The Voronezh regional governor said four people were injured in one drone strike.Ukraine has not commented on the strikes. It has been targeting Russia's energy infrastructure in retaliation to Russia's sustained bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid throughout the war.Russia's defence ministry said its air defences intercepted 93 Ukrainian drones overnight, 60 of which were over the Black Sea region.Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 83 drones or 76 drones and seven missiles overnight, 61 of which were shot down. It added that 16 drones and six missiles struck targets in eight locations.\n",
      "In the city of Kherson, regional head Oleksandr Prokudin called for a partial evacuation after the key Ostrivsky bridge was again hit on Sunday morning.The bridge linking the Korabel island district with the rest of the city had already been badly damaged in Russian strikes earlier this week. Some 1,800 people still live in the district.The new Russian strikes come after a particularly deadly week for civilians in Ukraine, including anattack on Kyiv on Thursday that killed at least 31 people.More than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles were launched in the assault, Ukrainian officials said, making the attack one of the deadliest on the capital since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.Following the strikes, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for stronger international sanctions on Russia this week, while US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine and suggested new sanctions against Moscow were coming.In July, Trump said Putin had 50 days to end the war, or Russia would face severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports.On Monday, Trump set a new \"10 or 12\" day deadline. He later set a new deadline, which would expire on 8 August....\n",

      "🔗 https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cn5e70v7lqqo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss\n",
      "📄 Fifth Rothesay Test, The Kia Oval (day four of five)India 224(Nair 57, Atkinson 5-33, Tongue 3-57) &396(Jaiswal 118; Tongue 5-125)England 247(Crawley 64; Krishna 4-62, Siraj 4-86) &339-6(Brook 111, Root 105)England need 35 runs to win; India need four wicketsScorecard\n",
      "England need 35 more runs with four wickets in hand to beat India in an astonishing final Test after a barely believable fourth day was halted by rain and bad light.In scenes of incredible tension and in a raucous atmosphere at The Oval, England reached 339-6 in pursuit of a record-breaking 374 when the weather wiped out the final hour's play.Sublime centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root looked to have England coasting to their target, only for India's outstanding seamers to deliver a grandstand finale.Brook, on 111, lost his bat in miscuing Akash Deep to mid-off, Jacob Bethell was bowled attempting a wild hack and a poking Root was caught behind for 105.Jamie Overton joined Surrey team-mate Jamie Smith on their home ground with 37 required. Chris Woakes, not seen since the first day because of a suspected dislocated shoulder, prepared to bat.Both Smith and Overton struggled to lay bat on ball as Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna summoned one final effort. The scoreboard barely moved.Overton had just survived a review for caught behind off Krishna when the umpires decided the light was not sufficient, then the rain arrived.It means this epic series will be concluded on Monday morning. Either England will win 3-1 or India will level at 2-2. The outcome is on a knife-edge.\n",
      "After seven weeks of drama, needle and outstanding cricket, perhaps it is only fitting that this memorable series will decided on the last possible day.Both sides might feel that this Test should already be won. That it is not is thanks to one of the most incredible days of sport you could ever wish to see, one that swung this way and that, then ended with neither side definitively holding an advantage.England fans were alive during Root and Brook's counter-attacking partnership of 195, spectators rising to their feet with every passing milestone. The Yorkshiremen seemingly had England on course for their second-highest run chase of all time and the best by any team on this ground.That India roared back says much about their spirit, the tireless effort of their seamers, and the energy they found from their wonderful supporters. On more than one occasion, the touring players looked to their fans, beating their chest and kissing the badge on their shirts.If anything, the end of play probably favours England. Before the stoppage, it looked like India could take a wicket with every ball. Then again, a night's rest gives the visiting seamers the opportunity to return fresh on Monday morning, with a new ball just under four overs away.There is also the prospect of the stricken Woakes coming out to bat with the Test and series on the line. What a finish.\n",
      "From 50-1 overnight, Ben Duckett looked a key man for England, only to edge Krishna for 54. Ollie Pope came and went to leave England 106-3. India were on course.But Brook had the audacity and skill to punch back. Root, who survived a tight lbw review from Krishna on three, is a maestro of guiding Test chases. They first halted India's momentum, then punished a weary attack in conditions better for batting than any other time in the match.Brook had only eight from 18 balls, then sparked into life with a pulled four and lofted off-side six off Akash Deep. In the next over came a crucial chance, with Brook on 19. A top edge off Krishna, Siraj underneath it, time standing still. Siraj took the catch, then stood on the rope.Brook regularly heaved through the on side, Root played trademark handsome drives. The crowd rose again for Brook's 91-ball century, reached with an edged from spinner Washington Sundar.A dance at Deep caused Brook to lose his bat and his wicket, Root went to tea on 98. The players returned in sunshine and to another roar, matched when Root went to his 39th Test hundred. In a match dedicated to the life of his mentor Graham Thorpe, Root celebrated by pulling on one of Thorpe's trademark white headbands, and looked to the sky.Bethell, short of cricket and his first home Test, was tortured for his five off 31 balls, eventually bowled trying a needless hack at Krishna.Nerves suddenly seemed to affect Root, who survived another review from Krishna, before poking the same bowler behind. From nowhere, the game was alive.\n",
      "Perhaps the abiding memory from this heart-stopping day will be the din made by India's fans during what turned out to be the final moments.India left themselves a seamer short in this Test, so almost all of the bowling has had to be done by Siraj, Krishna and Deep. Quite how they found the will to put England under so much pressure is unknown, but they were undoubtedly driven by the belief of their supporters.For so much of day four, the ball refused to move in the way it did across the first three days. The pitch looked flat bar some occasional low bounce. Out of nowhere after tea, Siraj and Krishna got the old ball talking.Smith and Overton were on a hiding to nothing. Every delivery could have resulted in a wicket. The England batters either played and missed or were struck on the body. The seventh-wicket pair were together for 20 balls and added two runs, one of which was a leg bye.The review for the catch behind off Overton was optimistic and gave umpire Kumar Dharmasena time to get twitchy about the light. A heavy shower arrived and it was decided the players would not be able to return before the cut-off of 18:42 BST.The crowd booed and dispersed. The sun was shining before the scheduled close but, by then, everyone was recovering from what they had been through.\n",
      "England batter Joe Root speaking to BBC Test Match Special:\"It is quite fitting for how the rest of the series has gone. It has ebbed and flowed all of the way through and this Test is exactly same. We are in for a cracker for tomorrow. It will be a great finish.\"On his headband tribute to Graham Thorpe:\"I wish I had it in my pocket from the start. I put it there at tea. He is someone who impacted the game in this country as player, coach, mentor and friend.\"That wasn't just from me but our whole dressing room.
